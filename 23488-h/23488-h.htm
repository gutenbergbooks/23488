<h2>EDITOR'S NOTE</h2>


<p>Within the compass of 120 pages it was impossible for me to
cover every event in this period. The "Forty-Five" itself
would have provided enough material to fill a volume of double
the size. I have therefore concentrated on the four events
which seemed to me most important&mdash;namely, the Darien
scheme, the Union of the Crowns, and the risings of 1715 and
1745. For the rest, I have endeavoured to illustrate, however
briefly, the religious, social, and industrial activities of the time.
As in my previous volume, I have drawn freely on the invaluable
publications of the Scottish Historical Society, and
my thanks are also due to Mr. William Cowan for permission
to print the extract which appears on p. 29.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<i>Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, from the Dissolution

Hogue</i>, vol. i., p. 215, by Sir John Dalrymple, Bart. (London
and Edinburgh: 1771.)</p></div>


<p>Of those who had offered their services to William for the
settlement of Scotland, three were eminent above the rest:
the Duke of Hamilton, the Marquis of Athole, and Lord Stair.
The Duke of Hamilton had disapproved of the measures of
the late reign, but without publicly opposing them. He had
observed the same cautious conduct with regard to the parties
of his countrymen. He took advantage of his rank to attend
none of those public cabals in which all party-measures had
been conducted in Scotland, from the time of the tables of the
covenant; and, by that singularity, appeared to be of no party,
at the same time when he was dealing in private with all
parties. Son of the illustrious house of Douglas, married to
the heiress of the house of Hamilton, related to the royal
family, and to most of the crowned heads of Europe, in succession
in right of his wife to the crown of Scotland, at a time
when the ancient families of Scotland were of importance in
the scale of government, because they were of importance in
their own country, his pre-eminence was seen by William, and
perhaps feared. He had been entrusted with none of the
secrets of the revolution from the ambiguity of his conduct.
Yet he took a violent side against King James upon his first
retreat, but made apologies to that Prince's friends, so soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
he heard of his return. William, therefore, affected to show
him the highest honours, cajolling him by those arts which
the Duke was in use to employ upon others. From hence,
and from the vanity of pre-eminence, he had consented to
preside in the Assembly at London, which offered the Prince
the administration of government. And hence, William gave
him all the influence of the court, to be president of that
convention which was to make the offer of government itself.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Athole was a subject of great consequence,
because his estate and power lay in the heart of the highlands.
He had concurred in all the measures of the two royal
brothers, and had been loaded with favours and honours by
both. Yet, upon news of James's retreat, he flew, from restlessness
of temper more than from principle, to London, while
Scotland was yet in disquiet; resolved, amid contending
Princes, to make the best terms for himself. He almost
alone, of all those who went to London to offer their service
to the Prince of Orange, returned home discontented; because
his views had been too sanguine, and because he was ashamed
of what he had done. His repentance he made offer of to the
friends of James in Scotland, which was received, and thanked
in public, but in secret distrusted.</p>

<p>Lord Stair had none of the external advantages of the other
two. Yet, from great reach of thought, and through knowledge
of men and parties gained from experience, he came to
be a considerable figure in party.... Upon the restoration
he attached himself to the Duke of Lauderdale. The furies of
that minister he often moderated, and often opposed, openly
when he could, secretly when he could not; yet still preserved
his friendship. After enduring many years the loss of his
rank and his country, from the injustice of the Duke of York,
he, at the age of seventy, assumed again his long-neglected
sword and cuirass, and came over with the Prince of Orange,
who was so fond of him that he carried him in his own ship.
The influence of Lord Stair in party was increased by that of
his son Sir John Dalrymple, a man distinguished above all by
the beauty of his person, and the power of his eloquence. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the wisdom and experience of the father, to the parts and show
of the son, rather than to the power of the Duke of Hamilton,
William, certain that the two former could never hope to be
pardoned by James, resolved to leave the management of
Scotland in the end; but, in the meantime, to make advantage
of the Duke's offers of service for the settlement of that country.</p>

<p>Of all those nobles whom James, when Duke of York, had
honoured with his friendship, and when King, graced with his
favours, a few only continued openly in his interest. Of these
the chief were the Duke of Gordon, a Roman Catholic, to
whom James had entrusted the castle of Edinburgh, a man
weak, and wavering in courage, but bound by shame and
religion; Lord Balcarres attached by affection, gratitude, and
that delicacy of sentiment which the love of letters commonly
inspires; and Lord Dundee, who had for ever before his eyes
ideas of glory, the duty of a soldier, and the example of the
great Montrose, from whose family he was descended. James
had entrusted the care of his civil concerns in Scotland to
Balcarres, and of his military ones to Dundee. William asked
both to enter into his service. Dundee refused without
ceremony. Balcarres confessed the trust which had been
put in him, and asked the King, if, after that, he could enter
into the service of another? William generously answered,
"I cannot say that you can." But added, "Take care that
you fall not within the law; for otherwise I shall be forced
against my will to let the law overtake you." The other
nobles of the late King's party waited for events, in hopes and
in fears from the old government and the new, intriguing with
both, and depended upon by neither.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CONVENTION_OF_ESTATES_1689" id="THE_CONVENTION_OF_ESTATES_1689"></a>THE CONVENTION OF ESTATES (1689).</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<i>Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, from the Dissolution
of the Last Parliament of Charles II. until the Sea-Battle off La
Hogue</i>, vol. i., p. 218, by Sir John Dalrymple, Bart. (London
and Edinburgh: 1771.)</p></div>


<p>The convention met on the 14th of March. As the governing
part of the boroughs had been modelled by King James,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the members sent up from thence should have been favourable
to his interests. But Lord Stair, whose views were extensive,
had taken care, in the paper which contained the offer of
administration to the Prince, to recommend that the borough-elections
should be made by a general poll of the burgesses;
an artifice which, while it took the blame of innovation off the
Prince, prepared the way for securing the elections to the
whigs and presbyterians. The parties at the convention first
tried their strengths in the choice of a president. The Duke
of Hamilton was set up by the new, the Marquis of Athole by
the old court: a singular situation, where both candidates
were distrusted, both by those who recommended, and by those
who elected them. The former was preferred by 40 votes
out of about 150 voters: a victory which, from the nature of
the human mind, determined the wavering. A committee of
elections was next named, consisting of nine whigs and three
tories. Sir John Dalrymple, who was an able lawyer, found it
easy to start objections to the returns of the opposite party,
and to remove those which were made against his own. The
committee in the house followed his opinions, because the
necessity of the times was made the excuse of partiality....</p>

<p>When the convention sat down, two letters were presented,
one from the present, and another from the late King of
England. The convention read both; but first passed an act,
that nothing contained in the last of them should dissolve their
assembly, or stop their proceeding to the settlement of the
nation. James's letter was written in the terms of a conqueror
and a priest; threatening the convention with punishment in
this world, and damnation in the next. And, as it was
counter-signed by Lord Melfort, a papist, and a minister
abhorred by the presbyterians, the style and the signature
hurt equally the interest which the letter was intended to
serve. No answer was given. William's letter, on the contrary,
was answered in strains of gratitude and respect; a
distinction which sufficiently showed what might be expected
with regard to the future resolutions of the assembly....</p>

<p>The revolution in England was brought about by a coalition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of whigs and tories; but, in Scotland, by the whigs almost
alone. Hence, the Scottish convention, instead of amusing
themselves with school disputes about words, which, while
they discovered the fine lines of party in England, had
embarrassed the English convention, struck their blow without
ceremony, and came to a resolution, that King James had, by
his evil deeds, <i>forfaulted</i> his right to the crown; a term which,
in the language of the law of Scotland, involved in it the
exclusion of all his posterity as well as his own. But, as this
resolution would have comprehended the other children of
James, as well as the young Prince, they agreed upon the
following explanation of the word <i>forfaulted</i>. "Agreed, that
the word <i>forfault</i>, in the resolution, should imply no other
alteration in the succession to the crown than the seclusion of
King James, the pretended Prince of Wales, and the children
that shall be procreated of either of their bodies." Only five
opposed these resolutions....</p>

<p>The convention next made offer of the crown to William
and Mary: a vote in which the Duke of Queensberry and
the Marquis of Athole concurred, although they had refused to
be present at the other. They reconciled their conduct by
saying, "That, since the throne was declared vacant by the
nation, they knew none so worthy to fill it as the Prince and
Princess of Orange"&mdash;a mixture of sentiment, intended to
please both Kings, but which, like most compliments of the
kind, pleased neither. From an excess of zeal which betrayed
the cause of it, the Duke of Hamilton demeaned himself to act
the part of a clerk; reading, at the ordinary place of proclamation,
the act of convention aloud to the mean multitude, who
found even their own vanity hurt in the sacrifice which was
made to it by the first man in the nation. With more dignity
the parliament accompanied the offer of the crown with such a
declaration of rights as laid open all the invasions upon the
constitution, not of the late King alone, but of his brother, and
ascertained every disputed pretension between the crown and
the subject; for, accustomed either to trample upon their
sovereigns, or to be trampled upon by them, the Scottish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
nation chose to leave nothing to be adjusted afterwards by the
vibration between the executive and legislative powers, which
had kept the English constitution almost continually in a just
medium between the imperiousness of the crown and the
licentiousness of the subject. The Earl of Argyle for the
peers, Sir James Montgomery for the knights, and Sir John
Dalrymple for the boroughs, were sent to London with the
offer of the crown....</p>

<p>The administration of the coronation-oath of Scotland was a
ceremony attended with much awe; the King holding up his
right hand high, whilst he swore, and repeated each word with
slowness after the person who read it. It contained a clause,
that the King should root out heretics. At these words,
William stopt the Earl of Argyle, who was administering the
oath, and declared, he did not mean to oblige himself to
become a persecutor. The commissioners answering, that
such was not the meaning of the oath: "Then," said the King,
"I take it in that sense only." Whether this scruple was the
effect of affectation or of delicacy, is immaterial: it became a
King, and it pleased the people.</p>

<p>Yesternight I received your lordship's of the 4th instant,
with one to General Major Mackay; I did the same night send
one to the west to dispatch some to Ireland for intelligence,
and write two several ways to the captains of our ships to go
to the coast of Ireland to cruise there, and give the best account
they could if there was any appearance of an invasion from
thence, which, I am confident, there is little fears of, if it be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
not by the French fleet, and it's very strange if they can be
able to come to our coasts and land men, if there be an English
and Dutch fleet at sea as you write, but if they should be able
to land any considerable force we should be in an ill condition,
considering how disaffected all the north is, and if we should
absolutely with all his forces recall Mackay before he dissipates
or beats Dundee, all that country generally, lowlands as well
as highlands, would be in arms with him; so, upon communicating
your letter to the Council this morning, they thought it
not fit absolutely to recall him, but leave it much to himself,
and desired him to send any of the English horse that is with
him to the west country, where they can be best provided with
horse meat, and most of our own new levied horse we intend
should go there also, and some regiments of our foot lays there
and about Stirling, the rest being in St. Johnston,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Dundie, and

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;On Friday last Major General Mackay marched
from St. Johnston with about 4000 foot, 4 troops of horse and
dragoons, and was at Dunkell that night, where he received

marched on Saturday towards him, and within two miles of
Blair about 5 at night they engaged, and by several inferior
officers and soldiers that is come here this evening, gives us
the account, that after a sharp engagement Dundie being
much stronger, the Major General was quite defeat, and I
have yet heard of no officers of quality that is come of but
Lieutenant Colonel Lauther, who my Lord Ruthven spoke
with as he came from St. Johnston this day, and gives the

<p>Being come up to the advanced party he<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> saw some small
parties of the enemy, the matter of a short mile, marching
slowly along the foot of a hill which lay towards Blair,
marching towards us; whereupon he sent orders to Balfour
to march up to him in all haste with the foot. But presently
upon that order, having discovered some bodies of them
marching down an high hill, within a quarter of a mile to
the place where he stood, when the gross<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of their body
appeared, fearing that they should take possession of an
eminence just above the ground where our forces halted on,
of a steep and difficult ascent, full of trees and shrubs, and
within a carbine shot of the place whereon we stood, whereby
they could undoubtedly force us with their fire in confusion
over the river, he galloped back in all haste to the forces, and
having made every battalion form by a Quart de Conversion
to the right upon the ground they stood, made them march
each before his face up the hill, by which means he prevented
that inconveniency, and got a ground fair enough to receive
the enemy, but not to attack them, there being, within a short
musket shot to it, another eminence before our front, as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
stood when we were up the lowest hill, near the river, whereof
Dundee had already got possession before we could be well
up, and had his back to a very high hill, which is the ordinary
maxim of Highlanders, who never fight against regular forces
upon anything of equal terms, without a sure retreat at their
back, particularly if their enemies be provided of horse; and
to be sure of their escape, in case of a repulse, they attack
bare footed, without any clothing but their shirts, and a little
Highland doublet, whereby they are certain to outrun any
foot, and will not readily engage where horse can follow
the chase any distance.... Shortly thereafter, and
about half an hour before sunset, they began to move down
the hill.</p>

<p>The General had already commanded the officers, commanding
battalions, to begin their firing at the distance of
100 paces by platoons, to discourage the approaching Highlanders,
meeting with continual fire: That part of their forces
which stood opposite to Hastings, who had the right of all,
before the Generals', Levin's and Kenmore's regiments, came
down briskly together with their horse, and notwithstanding
of a brisk fire, particularly from the General's own battalion,
whereby many of the chief gentlemen of the name of Macdonald,
who attacked it, were killed, pushed their point, after they
had fired their light pieces at some distance, which made little
or no execution, with sword in hand, tho' in great confusion,
which is their usual way. Which when the General observed,
he called to the Lord Belhaven to march up with the first
troop of horse, ordering him to flank to the left hand the
enemy, the fire being then past on all hands, and coming to
handy strokes if our men had stood, appointing the second
troop to do the same to the right; but scarcely had Belhaven
got them without the front of the line, where they had orders
to wheel for the flank, tho' their very appearance made the
enemy turn away from the place where they saw the horse
coming up, but contrary to orders, they began to pass, not
knowing whereat, and presently turned about, as did also
Kenmore's and the half of Levin's battalion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The General, observing the horse come to a stand, and firing
in confusion, and the foot beginning to fall away from him,
thinking happily that the horse would be picked to follow his
example, and in all cases to disengage himself out of the crowd
of Highlanders which came down just upon the place where
he was calling to the officers of the horse to follow him, spurr'd
his horse through the enemy, (where no body nevertheless
followed him, but one of his servants, whose horse was shot
in passing).... Having passed through the crowd of attacking
Highlanders, he turned about to see how matters stood,
and found that all his left had given way, and got down
the hill which was behind our line, ranged a little above
the brow thereof, so that in the twinkling of an eye in a
manner, our men, as well as the enemy, were out of sight,
being got down pall mall to the river where our baggage
stood....</p>

<p>The enemy lost on the field six for our one, the fire to our
right having been continued and brisk, whereby not only
Dundee, with several gentlemen of quality of the countys of
Angus and Perth, but also many of the best gentlemen among
the Highlanders, particularly of the Macdonalds of the Isles
and Glengarie, were killed, coming down the hill upon Hastings,
the General, and Levin's regiments, which made the best fire
and all the execution....</p>

<p>The General having got the small rests of his forces safely
over the river, and seeing no disposition, so far as he could
discern, of the enemy to pursue him, he bethought himself
which way he had best retire; and notwithstanding of the
contrary advice of all the officers who would have him to
descend the plain country of Athole to Dunkeld and Perth,
he resolved rather to march into the Highlands three or four
miles, and then over to Strath Tay and along the foot of the
hills, over the Castle of Drummond, where he had a garrison,
to Stirling, whither he resolved to make all the speed possible,
to fall upon some present measures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His Majesties Remarques</span> upon the Act for settling
Church Government in Scotland, Which, together with some
reasons designed for the clearing of it, and answering those
objections that might be made against it, was sent to him by
My Lord Commissioner.</p>

<p>1st, Whereas it is said that the Church of Scotland was
reformed from Poperie, <i>by Presbyters without Prelacy</i>, his Majesty
thinks, that tho this matter of fact may be true, which he doth
not contradict, yet it being denied by some who discourse much
of a power that Superintendents had in the beginning of the
Reformation, which was like to that which Bishops afterwards
had, it were better it were otherwise expressed.</p>

<p>2d, Whereas it is said that their Majesties do ratify the
Presbyterial Church Government <i>to be the only Government of
Christ's Church in this kingdom</i>; his Majesty desires it may be
expressed thus,&mdash;to be the government of the Church in this
Kingdom established by law.</p>

<p>3d, Whereas it is said that the government is to be exercised
by sound Presbyterians, and such as for hereafter shall be owned
by Presbyterian Church Judicatories, <i>as such</i>; his Majesty
thinks that the rule is too general, depending as to its application
upon the opinions of particular men; and therefore he
desires that what is said to be the meaning of the rule in the
reasons sent to him, may be expressed in the Act, viz., That
such as shall subscribe to the Confession of Faith and
Catechisms, and are willing to submit to the government of
the Church, as established by law, being sober in their lives,
sound in their doctrine, and qualified with gifts for the ministry,
shall be admitted to the government, and his Majesty doth
judge that the following Declaration might be a good Test:&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I, A&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash; do sincerely declare, and promise, that
I will own and submit to the present government of the

suppressing of sin and wickedness, the promoting of piety,
and the purging of the Church of all erroneous and
scandalous Ministers; and I do also assent and consent
to the Confession of Faith, and the Larger and Shorter
Catechisms, now confirmed by Act of Parliament, as the
Standard of the Protestant religion in this Kingdom.</p></div>

<p>... 5th, As to what concerns the meeting of Synods and
General Assemblies, his Majesty is willing that it should be
enacted, that they meet at such and such times of the year,
and as often as shall be judged necessary, provided always, that
they apply to him or his Privy Council to know if there be any
inconveniency as to public affairs in their meeting at such
times, and have his allowance accordingly; and that in all their
General Assemblies, a Commissioner in the name of his Majesty
be there present, to the end, that nothing may be proposed, but
what merely concerns the Church; and in case anything
relating to the Civil government, or that is prejudicial to it,
should be there proposed or debated, the said Commissioner
may give a stop to it, till he has acquainted the Privy Council,
and received their direction in it.</p>

<p>6th, Whereas it is desired to be enacted, that the parishes of
those thrust out by the people in the beginning of this
Revolution be declared Vacant upon this reason, <i>because they
were put upon congregations without their consent</i>, his Majesty
desires it may be so expressed, as may be consistent with the
rights of Patrons, which he thinks he hath the more reason to
desire, because in the reasons sent up with the Act, it seems to
be acknowledged that this procedure is Extraordinary, and not
to be drawn into consequence....</p>

<p>His Majesties resolution to be candid and above board in
what he does, and his desire, that what is now granted by him
to the Church may not be uneasie to him afterwards, do incline
him to have the above-mentioned amendments in the Act.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>It is his Majesties desire, that such as are of the Episcopal
persuasion in Scotland have the same Indulgence that
Dissenters have in England, provided they give security to
live peaceably under the Government, and take the Oath of
Allegiance.</p>

<p class="hd5"><span class="smcap">C. Report of the Commission given by His Majesty,
under the Great Seal, 29th April, 1695, for
inquiring into the Slaughter of the Men of
Glenco, 13th February, 1692</span> (<i>idem</i>, p. 99).</p>

<p class="rdate"><i>At Holyrudhouse, 20th June, 1695.</i></p>

<p>... The things to be remark'd preceding the said slaughter
were, that it's certain that the Lairds of Glenco and Auchintriaten,
and their followers, were in the insurrection and
rebellion made by some of the Highland clans, under the
command, first of the Viscount of Dundee, and then of Major-Gen.
Buchan, in the years 1689 and 1690. This is acknowledg'd
by all. But when the Earl of Breadalbane called the heads of
the clans, and met with them at Auchallader, in July 1691, in
order to a cessation, the deceas'd Alexander Macdonald of
Glenco was there, with Glengary, Sir John Maclene, and
others, and agreed to the cessation; as it is also acknowledg'd....
And here the Commissioners cannot but take notice of
what hath occurr'd to them in two letters from Secretary Stair,
to Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, one of the 1st, and another of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the 3d of December, 1691, wherein he expresses his resentment
from the marring of the bargain that should
have been betwixt the Earl of Breadalbane and the Highlanders,
to a very great height; ... &mdash;And, in effect, seems,
even at that time, which was almost a month before the
expiring of the King's indemnity, to project, with Lieutenant-Colonel
Hamilton, that some of them should be rooted out and
destroyed. His Majesty's proclamation of indemnity was
publish'd in Aug. 1691, offering a free indemnity and pardon
to all the Highlanders who had been in arms, upon their coming
in, and taking the oath of allegiance, betwixt then and the first of
January thereafter: And, in compliance with the proclamation,
the deceas'd Glenco goes, about the end of Decemb. 1691, to
Col. Hill, Governor of Fort William at Inverlochie, and desir'd
the Colonel to minister to him the oath of allegiance, that he
might have the King's indemnity: But Col. Hill, in his
deposition, doth further depone, that he hasten'd him away
all he could, and gave him a letter to Ardkinlas to receive him
as a lost sheep; ... Sir Colin Campbell of Ardkinlas, Sherif-Deput
of Argyle, depones, that the deceas'd Glenco came to
Inverary about the beginning of January, 1692, with a letter
from Colonel Hill, to the effect above mentioned, and was
three days there before Ardkinlas could get thither, because of
bad weather; and that Glenco said to him, that he had not
come sooner because he was hinder'd by the storm; and
Ardkinlas farther depones, that when he declin'd to give the
oath of allegiance to Glenco, because the last of December,
the time appointed for the taking of it, was past, Glenco begg'd,
with tears, that he might be admitted to take it, and promis'd
to bring in all his people within a short time to do the like,
and, if any of them refused, they should be imprisoned, or sent
to Flanders: upon which, Ardkinlas says, he did administer to
him the oath of allegiance upon the 6th of January, 1692....</p>

<p>These things having preceded the slaughter, which happen'd
not to be committed until the 13th of February, 1692, six
weeks after the deceas'd Glenco had taken the oath of
allegiance at Inverary. The slaughter of the Glenco men was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in this manner, viz., John and Alexander MacDonalds, sons
to the deceas'd Glenco, depone, that Glengary's house being
reduc'd, the forces were called back to the south, and Glenlyon,
a captain of the Earl of Argyle's regiment, with Lieutenant
Lindsay, and Ensign Lindsay, and six score soldiers, return'd
to Glenco about the 1st of February, 1692, where, at their
entry, the elder brother, John, met them, with about 20 men,
and demanded the reason of their coming; and Lieutenant
Lindsay showed him his orders for quartering there, under
Colonel Hill's hand, and gave assurance that they were only
come to quarter; whereupon they were billeted in the country,
and had free quarters, and kind entertainment, living familiarly
with the people until the 13th day of Feb.; and Alexander
farther depones, that Glenlyon, being his wife's uncle, came
almost every day, and took his morning drink at his house,
and that the very night before the slaughter, Glenlyon did play
at cards, in his own quarters, with both the brothers; and
John depones, that old Glenco, his father, had invited Glenlyon,
Lieutenant Lindsay, and Ensign Lindsay, to dine with him
upon the very day the slaughter happened. But, on the
13th day of February, being Saturday, about four, or five, in
the morning, Lieutenant Lindsay, with a party of the foresaid
soldiers, came to old Glenco's house, where, having call'd, in a
friendly manner, and got in, they shot his father dead, with
several shots, as he was rising out of his bed; and, the mother
having got up, and put on her clothes, the soldiers stripp'd her
naked, and drew the rings off her fingers with their teeth; as
likewise they killed one man more, and wounded another
grievously, at the same place.... And the said John,
Alexander, and Archibald MacDonalds, do all depone, that, the
same morning, there was one Sergeant Barber, and a party, at
Auchnaion, and that Auchintriaten being there, in his brother's
house, with eight more, sitting about the fire, the soldiers
discharged upon them about 18 shot, which killed Auchintriaten,
and four more; ... And, at Innerriggin, where
Glenlyon was quartered, the soldiers took other nine men, and
did bind them, hand and foot, [and] kill'd them, one by one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
with shot; and, when Glenlyon inclin'd to save a young man,
of about 20 years of age, one Captain Drummond came, and
ask'd how he came to be sav'd in respect of the orders that
were given, and shot him dead; and another young boy, of
about 13 years, ran to Glenlyon, to be sav'd. He was likewise
shot dead.... And all these five witnesses concur, that the
aforesaid slaughter was made by Glenlyon, and his soldiers,
after they had been quarter'd, and liv'd peaceably, and friendly,
with the Glenco men about 13 days, and that the number of
those whom they knew to be slain were about 25, and that the
soldiers, after the slaughter, did burn the houses, barns, and
goods, and carried away a great spoil of horse, nolt,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
sheep, above a 1,000.</p>

<p>... And upon the whole matter, it is the opinion of the
Commission, First, that it was a great wrong that Glenco's
case, and diligence as to his taking the oath of allegiance, with
Ardkinlas's certificate of his taking the oath of allegiance on
the 6th of January, 1692, and Col. Hill's letter to Ardkinlas,
and Ardkinlas's letter to Colin Campbell, Sheriff-Clerk, for
clearing Glenco's diligence and innocence, were not presented
to the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Council, when they were
sent into Edinburgh, in the said month of January, and that
those who advis'd the not presenting thereof were in the wrong,
and seem to have had a malicious design against Glenco; ...
Secondly, that it appears to have been known at London, and
particularly to the Master of Stair, in the month of January,
1692, that Glenco had taken the oath of allegiance, tho' after
the day prefix'd; for he saith, in his letter of the 30th of
January, to Sir Tho. Livingston, as is above remark'd, "I am
glad that Glenco came not in within the time prescrib'd."
Thirdly, that there was nothing in the King's instructions to
warrant the committing of the foresaid slaughter, even as to the
thing it self, and far less as to the manner of it, seeing all his
instructions do plainly import, that the most obstinate of the
rebels might be received into mercy upon taking the oath of
allegiance, tho' the day was long before elaps'd, and that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
ordered nothing concerning Glenco and his tribe, but that "if"
they could "be well separated from the rest, it" would "be a
proper indication of the publick justice to extirpate that sept of
thieves"; which plainly intimates, that it was his Majesty's
mind that they could not be separated from the rest of these
rebels, unless they still refused his mercy by continuing in
arms and refusing the allegiance, and that, even in that case,
they were only to be proceeded against in the way of publick
justice, and no other way.</p>

<p class="hd4">Act for Erecting a Publick Bank.</p>

<p>Our Sovereign Lord considering how useful a Publick Bank
may be in this Kingdom according to the custom of other
kingdoms and states, and that the same can only be best set up
and managed by persons in company with a Joynt Stock,
sufficiently endowed with these powers and authorities and
liberties necessary and usual in such cases, Hath therefore
allowed, and with the advice and consent of the Estates of
Parliament allows, a joynt stock amounting to the sum of
twelve hundred thousand pounds money to be raised by the
Company hereby established for the carrying on and managing
of a publick bank. And further statutes and ordains, with
advice foresaid, that the persons under-named ... shall have
power to appoint a Book for subscriptions of persons, either
natives or foreigners, who shall be willing to subscribe and
pay into the joynt stock, Which subscriptions the foresaids
persons or their quorum are hereby authorized to receive in
the foresaid book, which shall lie open every tuesday or friday
from nine to twelve in the forenoon, and from three to six in
the afternoon betwixt the first day of November next and the
first day of January next following, in the publick hall or
chamber to be appointed in the City of Edinburgh. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
therein all persons shall have liberty to subscribe for such
sums of money as they shall think fit to adventure in the said
joynt stock, one thousand pound Scots being the lowest sum,
and twenty thousand pound Scots the highest. And the two
third parts of the saids stocks belonging always to persons
residing in Scotland. Likeas, each and every person at the
time of his subscribing shall pay into the hands of the fore-named
persons, or any three of them, ten of the hundred of the
sums set down in their respective subscriptions towards the
carrying on the Bank. And all and every the persons subscribing
and paying into the said stock, as aforsaid, shall be
and are hereby declared to be one Body Corporat and
Politique, by the name of <span class="smcap">the Governour and Company of
the Bank of Scotland</span>, under which name they shall have
perpetual succession, and shall have a Common Seal....</p>

<p>And it is farder hereby statute and ordained that it shall be
lawful for the said Governour and Company to lend, upon real
or personal security, any sum or sums, and to receive annual
rent for the same at six per cent., as shall be ordinary for the

not make payment at the time agreed upon with the Company,
then it shall be lawful for the Governour and Company to sell
and dispose of the security or pledge by a public roup, for the
most that can be got for payment to them of the principal
annual rents and reasonable charges, and returning the over-plus
to the person who gave the said security or pledge....</p>

<p>It is hereby statute that the joynt stock of the said Bank,
continuing in money, shall be free from all publick burdens to
be imposed upon money for the space of twenty one years after
the date hereof. And that during this space it shall not be

<p>Another act passed, that has already produced very fatal
consequences to that kingdom<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; and may yet draw worse after
it: the interlopers in the East India trade, finding that the
company was like to be favoured by the parliament, as well as
by the court, were resolved to try other methods to break in
upon that trade: they entered into a treaty with some merchants
in Scotland; and they had, in the former session, procured an
act, that promised letters patents to all such as should offer to
set up new manufactures, or drive any new trade, not yet
practised by that kingdom, with an exemption for twenty-one
years from all taxes and customs, and with all such other
privileges, as should be found necessary for establishing or
encouraging such projects. But here was a necessity of
procuring letters patents, which they knew the credit that the
East India company had at court would certainly render
ineffectual. So they were now in treaty for a new act, which
should free them from that difficulty.</p>

<p>There was one Paterson, a man of no education, but of great
notions; which, as was generally said, he had learned from the
Buccaneers, with whom he had consorted for some time. He
had considered a place in Darien, where he thought a good
settlement might be made, with another over against it, in the
South Sea; and by two settlements there, he fancied a great
trade might be opened both for the East and West Indies; and
that the Spaniards in the neighbourhood might be kept in great
subjection to them; so he made the merchants believe, that he
had a great secret, which he did not think fit yet to discover,
and reserved to a fitter opportunity; only he desired, that the
West Indies might be named in any new act that should be
offered to the parliament: he made them in general understand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that he knew of a country, not possessed by Spaniards, where
there were rich mines, and gold in abundance. While these
matters were in treaty, the time of the King's giving the
instructions to his commissioner for the parliament came on;
and it had been a thing of course, to give a general instruction,
to pass all bills for the encouragement of trade. Johnstoun
told the King, that he heard there was a secret management
among the merchants for an act in Scotland, under which the
East India trade might be set up; so he proposed, and drew an
instruction, impowering the commissioner to pass any bill,
promising letters patents for encouraging of trade, yet limited,
so that it should not interfere with the trade of England: when
they went down to Scotland, the King's commissioner either
did not consider this, or had no regard to it; for he gave the
royal assent to an act, that gave the undertakers, either of the
East India or West India trade, all possible privileges, with
exemption of twenty-one years from all impositions: and the
act directed letters patents to be passed under the great seal,
without any further warrant for them: when this was printed,
it gave a great alarm in England, more particularly to the East
India company; for many of the merchants of London resolved
to join stock with the Scotch company; and the exemption
from all duties gave a great prospect of gain. Such was the
posture of affairs in Scotland....</p>

<p>Great complaints were made in both houses of the act for
the Scotch East India company, and addresses were made to
the King, setting forth the inconveniencies that were like to
arise from thence to England: the King answered, that he had
been ill served in Scotland: but he hoped remedies should be
found, to prevent the ill consequences that they apprehended
from the act: and soon after this, he turned out both the
secretaries of state, and the marquis of Tweedale: and great
changes were made in the whole ministry of that Kingdom,
both high and low....</p>

<p>But when it was understood in Scotland that the King had
disowned the act for the East India company, from which it
was expected that great riches should flow into that Kingdom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it is not easy to conceive how great and how general an
indignation was spread over the whole kingdom: the Jacobites
saw what a game it was like to prove in their hands; they
played it with great skill, and to the advantage of their cause,
in a course of many years; and continue to manage it to this
day: there was a great deal of noise made of the Scotch act in
both houses of parliament in England, by some who seemed to
have no other design in that, but to heighten our distractions
by the apprehensions that they expressed. The Scotch nation
fancied nothing but mountains of gold; and the credit of the
design rose so high, that subscriptions were made, and advances
of money were offered, beyond what any believed the wealth of
that Kingdom could have furnished. Paterson came to have
such credit among them, that the design of the East India
trade, how promising soever, was wholly laid aside: and they
resolved to employ all their wealth in the settling a colony,
with a port and fortifications, in Darien; which was long kept
a secret, and was only trusted to a select number, who assumed
to themselves the name of the African company, though they
never meddled with any concern in that part of the world; the
unhappy progress of the affair will appear in its proper time.</p>

<p>... The company in Scotland, this year, set out a fleet,
with a colony, on design to settle in America: the secret was
better kept than could have been well expected, considering
the many hands in which it was lodged; it appeared at last,
that the true design had been guessed, from the first motion of
it: they landed at Darien, which, by the report that they sent
over, was capable of being made a strong place, with a good
port. It was no wonder that the Spaniards complained loudly
of this; it lay so near Porto Bello and Panama on the one side,
and Carthagena on the other, that they could not think they
were safe, when such a neighbour came so near the centre of
their Empire in America: the King of France complained also
of this, as an invasion of the Spanish dominions, and offered
the court of Madrid a fleet to dislodge them. The Spaniards
pressed the King hard upon this: they said, they were once
possessed of that place; and though they found it too unhealthy
to settle there, yet the right to it belonged still to them: so this
was a breach of treaties, and a violent possession of their country.
In answer to this, the Scotch pretended, that the natives of
Darien were never conquered by the Spaniards, and were by
consequence a free people; they said, they had purchased of
them leave to possess themselves of that place, and that the
Spaniards abandoned the country, because they could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
reduce the natives: so the pretension of the first discovery
was made void, when they went off from it, not being able to
hold it; and then the natives being left to themselves, it was
lawful for the Scots to treat with them: it was given out, that
there was much gold in the country. Certainly, the nation
was so full of hopes from this project, that they raised a fund
for carrying it on, greater than, as was thought, that kingdom
could stretch to; four hundred thousand pounds sterling was
subscribed, and a fourth part was paid down, and afterwards,
seventy thousand pounds more was brought in, and a national
fury seemed to have transported the whole kingdom, upon this
project.</p>

<p>... Our English plantations grew ... very jealous of this
new colony: they feared, that the double prospect of finding
gold and of robbing the Spaniards, would draw many planters
from them into this new settlement; and that the buccaneers
might run into them: for by the Scotch act, this place was to
be made a free port; and if it was not ruined before it was
well formed, they reckoned it would become a seat of piracy
and another Algiers in those parts. Upon these grounds, the
English nation inclined to declare against this, and the King
seemed convinced, that it was an infraction of his treaties with
Spain: so orders were sent, but very secretly, to the English
plantations, particularly to Jamaica and the Leeward islands,
to forbid all commerce with the Scots at Darien. The Spaniards
made some faint attempts on them, but without success. This
was a very great difficulty on the King; he saw how much he
was like to be pressed on both hands, and he apprehended
what ill consequences were like to follow, on his declaring himself
either way.</p>

<p>In Scotland all men were full of hopes, that their new colony
should bring them home mountains of gold; the proclamations
sent to Jamaica and to the other English plantations were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
much complained of, as acts of hostility, and a violation of the
common rights of humanity; these had a great effect on them,
though without these, that colony was too weak and too ill
supplied, as well as too much divided within itself, to have
subsisted long; those, who had first possessed themselves of
it, were forced to abandon it: soon after they had gone from
it, a second recruit of men and provisions was sent thither
from Scotland; but one of their ships unhappily took fire, in
which they had the greatest stock of provisions; and so these
likewise went off: and though the third reinforcement, that
soon followed this, was both stronger and better furnished, yet
they fell into such factions among themselves, that they were
too weak to resist the Spaniards, who, feeble as they were, yet
saw the necessity of attacking them: and they finding themselves
unable to resist the force which was brought against
them, capitulated; and with that the whole design fell to the
ground, partly for want of stock and skill in those who managed
it, and partly by the baseness and treachery of those whom
they employed.</p>

<p>The conduct of the King's ministers in Scotland was much
censured in the whole progress of this affair; for they had
connived at it, if not encouraged it, in hopes that the design
would fall of itself; but now it was not so easy to cure the
universal discontent, which the miscarriage of this design, to
the impoverishing the whole kingdom, had raised, and which
now began to spread, like a contagion, among all sorts of
people. A petition for a present session of parliament was
immediately sent about the kingdom, and was signed by many
thousands: this was sent up by some of the chief of their
nobility, whom the King received very coldly: yet a session
of parliament was granted them, to which the duke of Queensbury
was sent down commissioner ... it was further given
out, to raise the national disgust yet higher, that the opposition
the King gave to the Scotch colony, flowed neither from a
regard to the interests of England, nor to the treaties with
Spain, but from a care of the Dutch, who from Curasoe<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a coasting trade, among the Spanish plantations, with great
advantage; which, they said, the Scotch colony, if once well
settled, would draw wholly from them.... In the session
of parliament it was carried by a vote, to make the affair of
Darien a national concern: upon that, the session was for
some time discontinued. When the news of the total abandoning
of Darien was brought over, it cannot be well expressed
into how bad a temper this cast the body of that people: they
had now lost almost two hundred thousand pounds sterling
upon this project, besides all the imaginary treasure they had
promised themselves from it: so the nation was raised into
a sort of a fury upon it, and in the first heat of that, a remonstrance
was sent about the kingdom for hands, representing
to the King, the necessity for a present sitting of the parliament,
which was drawn in so high a strain, as if they had
resolved to pursue the effects of it by an armed force. It was
signed by a great majority of the members of parliament; and
the ferment in men's spirits was raised so high, that few thought
it could have been long curbed, without breaking forth into
great extremities.</p>

<p>A Convention of Estates followed the Revolution by King
William in 1688, which was afterwards turned into a Parliament,
and continued 'till the Death of that King in 1702. The
same parliament continued to sit upon the accession of Queen
Ann to the Crown, and was not dissolved till the year 1703,
when the new Parliament was called.... I have thrown
together some observations on this session of Parliament in
another Manuscript book, so shall say little here. It was
divided into 3 factions, who, as they had different views,
drove different ways. The first was what was called the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Court party; they were for supporting the Crown and the
Credit of the High Commissioner, consequently they were for
giving moderate subsidies for supporting the Government
against the insults of the French, with whom we were, at that
time, in war. They had the union of the two nations in view,
because they not only considered it as the happiest thing that
could be brought about for the Interest of Great Britain, but
because it was expressly recommended to them by the Queen.
The second faction was that of the Jacobites; they were to
thwart and disturb the Administration at any rate. The third
faction was what went under the name of the Squadrone
Volante. These consisted of about fifteen Lords and Gentlemen,
all Whigs in their principles, but who herded together,
and kept little or no communication with the Duke of Queensberry<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and his Friends. They were for opposing everything
which they durst oppose, but to keep firmly in their view the
succession of the Crown in the House of Hanover. They
pretended to be great Patriots, and to stand up chiefly in
defence of the rights and privileges of the subjects; in a word,
the public good and the liberty of the subjects were still in
their mouths, but in their Hearts they were known to have
Court preferments and places in the chiefest degree of veneration.
These were the springs and motives of all their Actions,
which appeared in a hundred instances thereafter. However,
by the bye, I must say that such a Squadrone Volante in any
Parliament seems to be always a happy means in the hand of
Providence to keep the several members of an Administration
in their duty, for people in great power seldom fail to take
more upon them than falls to their share.</p>

<p>The chiefs of the Squadrone Lords were the Dukes of
Montrose and Roxburgh, the Earls of Rothes and Haddington,
all these young men of about 24 years of Age; but the chief of
all, at least the man under whose name they principally voted,
was the Marquis of Tweeddale, a very good Man, but not
perfectly qualified for Court intrigues.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst their Gentlemen was one Mr. Fletcher of Saltoun,
a Man of Republican principles, who had spent his youth in
Holland, had been forfeited under the late King James, but
afterwards restored under King William by Act of Parliament.
He was a man a little untoward in his temper, and much
inclined to Eloquence. He made many speeches in Parliament,
which are all printed, but was not very dexterous in
making extemporary replies. He was, however, a very Honest
Man, and meant well in everything he said and did, except in
cases where his humour, passion, or prejudices were suffered
to get the better of his reason.</p>

<p>It hapned whilst we were at Edenborough, that the Act for a
treaty of Union, between England and Scotland, was upon
debate, and having the honour to have severall Lords and
Members of parliament often dine with us, they inform'd us of
the Grand day when the Act was to be past or rejected, and by
speciall favour of my Lord high Commissioner, we had leave
to stand upon the throne by his right hand: The usuall way
to admit strangers is to give them a battoon; which holding in
their hands, shows that they are forreigners. The Lords and
Comons sit together; As soon as we heard the names call'd
over, We observ'd Dukes, Marquesses, and Earles sat on the
Uppermost seats on the right hand, Viscounts and Barons on
the uppermost Seats of the left, The Knights of the Shires
under the Dukes, Marquesses, and Earles, and the Burgesses
and Commoners under the Viscounts and Barons. The Lord
Chancellor under the Commissioner's Throne, The Lord
Treasurer on his right hand, and the Secretary of State on his
left, and directly under him the Lord Justice Clerk, and at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
head of a long Table, on which is plac't the Crown, Scepter,
and Sword, the Earle Marshall; The Lord high Commissioner
has his Commission always before him in a velvet purse on his
cushion.</p>

<p>When they began to debate, we observ'd that the principall
leading men of the High party, or those which oppos'd the
Court, were the Duke of H&mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the Duke of A&mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the
Lord C&mdash;&mdash;y,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the Lord B&mdash;a&mdash;en,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and one Fletcher of
Salton, who speaks well, but with a great deal of passion, The
Earle of S&mdash;f&mdash;d,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> who is Lord C&mdash;&mdash;r,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is a very ingenious
man, His cheif perfection, and what is most requisite for his
office in the house, is resuming debates, which he does with an
admirable dexterity, by giving soe happy a turn for the Interest
of the party he espouses, that he generally carryes the point,
without the censure of either party. The Lord high Commissioner
says nothing; The Duke of Ar&mdash;&mdash;e<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was thought, as
we were told not only too young for so high a Station, but too
warm to bear the Reflections of some of the leading Malcontents,
but on the contrary he behav'd himself in this
criticall juncture, with so sedate and even a Temper, that he
justly gain'd an universall reputation, and brought the Sessions
to a happy conclusion. The Lord Chancellor determines upon
all debates who shall speak first, when anything is put to the
vote, every member is call'd by his name, and answers singly,
approven, or not approven. The grand debate this day, being
about the Act for a treaty with England, many learned
speeches were made on the occasion. Some were for passing
no Act till England had given them satisfaction for the affront
they pretended was put upon them, by the Act pass'd last
Sessions in England, which not only declar'd them Aliens, but
prohibited their goods, and thereby touch't them in the most
sensible part. Fletcher said, that England could not make
them Aliens, since they were naturall born subjects to the
Queen; ... After his debate, others were for making the
English Aliens in Scotland, as a Retaliation for our making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
them soe in England: ... But after many other debates,
and hard reflections on the English, it was at last put to the
Vote, whether there should be added a clause to the Act of
treaty, which should prohibit any treaty with England, till
England had rescinded the Clause of Aliens, or whether it
should be in a seperate way. Seperate way was carry'd by
two Voices, ... The next great point was, whether the
Queen or parliament should have nomination of Commissioners:
... 'Twas carry'd the Queen should nominate by 4
Voices. Then a Gentleman propos'd to add a clause, to preserve
the discipline and Worship of the Kirk of Scotland, as at
present establish'd: One propos'd it should be the Religion
and Discipline, but my Lord Chancellor told them, that was
all the same thing, and H&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> said, 'twas not worth a Vote,
and his brother the Earl of R&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> ask't whether they might
not add the Lord's prayer and Creed, and indeed by what I
could observe, they would add the whole Common Liturgy of
the Church of England, for they seem'd to be quite tir'd of the
Kirk discipline: Now the whole Act being finish'd, the Vote
was put whether it should be carry'd approven, or no, and
'twas carry'd approven, by 34 voices. As soon as this was
over, we left the house, and that night Collonell Ogilby,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the
Lord Chancellor's brother, the Lord Hardress,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and severall
Lords and parliament men, came to our lodgings, and embrac'd
us with all the outward marks of love and kindness, and
seem'd mightily pleas'd at what was done; and told us we
should now be no more English and Scotch, but Brittons.
And thus we merrily spent the night, in drinking to the
Success of the treaty and happy union, and next day, Colonell
Ogilby and some Scotch Lords enquir'd mightily for the 3
English Gentlemen, as they call'd us, having a mind to give us
a chirrupping Cup,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but we went to Leith that day, being
willing to avoid them.</p>

<p>We of the Committee of Parliament for the publick accompts
continued our applications to the matters remitted to us till
the Parliament met in September 1705. John, Duke of Argyle,
a youth of about 23 years of age, was appointed her Majesty's
High Commissioner, and in this station behaved himself in
a manner far above what cou'd be expected from one of his
years.... A ... great benefit I received by my intimacy
with the Duke and his brother was to be recommended to the
Queen for one of the Commissioners to be appointed by Her
Majesty for the Treaty of Union between England and Scotland.... This
choise, however honourable to me, was very
far from giving me the least pleasure or satisfaction, for I had
observed a great backwardness in the Parliament of Scotland
for an Union with England of any kind whatsoever, and therefore
doubted not but, after a great deal of expense in attending
a Treaty in England, I should be oblidged to return with the
uneasy reflexion of having either done nothing, or nothing to
the purpose, as had been the case of former Commissioners
appointed for this end. I was, in short, upon the point of
refusing the Honour conferred upon me, and the rather that
my Father, whom I always considered as an Oracle seldom
mistaken, seemed not to approve of it. However, as at last
he grew passive, and that the Duke of Queensberry threatened
to withdraw all friendship for me, I suffered my self to be
prevailed upon, and to take journey for London with other
Commissioners, and arrived there on the 13 of Aprile 1706.</p>

<p>... The Commissioners of both nations met in different
apartments in the Royal palace of Westminster, which commonly
goes under the name of the Cockpit. There was one
great Room where they all met when they were called upon to
attend the Queen, or were to exchange papers, but they never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
met to hold conferences together except once, when the number
of the Scotch Representatives for the two Houses of the British
Parliament came to be debated, all their transactions were
reduced in writings concerted in seperat apartments. When
proposals or Conditions of the Union were to be made by the
English Commissioners, the Scots were desired to meet them
in the great Room, and their proposals were given in by the
L<sup>d</sup> Chancellor, or the Keeper of the great seal, who was at
that time the Lord Cooper, and when the Commissioners for
Scotland had any thing to propose, or had answers to be made
to the Commissioners of England, these were presented by the
L<sup>d</sup> Seafield, then Chancellor for Scotland....</p>

<p>The first grand point debated by the Commissioners for
Scotland amongst themselves was whether they should propose
to the English a Federal union between the two nations, or an
Incorporating union. The first was most favoured by the
people of Scotland, but all the Scots Commissioners, to a Man,
considered it ridiculous and impracticable, for that in all the
Federal unions there behoved to be a supreme power lodged
somewhere, and wherever this was lodged it henceforth became
the States General, or, in our way of speaking, the Parliament
of Great Britain, under the same royal power and authority as
the two nations are at present. And in things of the greatest
consequence to the two nations, as in Councils relating to
peace and war and subsidies, it was impossible that the
Representatives or their suffrages in both nations cou'd be
equal, but must be regulated in proportion to the power and
riches of the several publick burdens or Taxations that cou'd
affect them; in a word, the Scots Commissioners saw that no
Union cou'd subsist between the two nations but an incorporating
perpetual one. But after all the trouble we gave
ourselves to please the people of Scotland, we knew at the
time that it was but losing our labour, for the English
Commissioners were positively resolved to treat on no kind
of union with us but what was to be incorporating and
perpetual....</p>

<p>The Queen came among us three several times, once at our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
first or second meeting, to acquaint us of her intentions and
ardent good wishes for our success and unanimity in this
great Transaction. At about a month thereafter she came
again to enquire of our success, and had most of our Minutes
read to her, and for the last time of what we had done....</p>

<p>I was ... intrusted with another province by the Commissioners
for Scotland, which was to review the Calculations
made for the Equivalent to be paid to Scotland for bearing
their share of the Debt of England, which were afterwards to
be considered as the Debts of Great Britain. These calculations
were chiefly made by Doctor Gregory, professor of
Mathematicks in the College of Oxford, and a certain great
accomptant and projector, one Patersone,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> from Scotland, but
bred in England from his infancy....</p>

<p>One day I had occasion to observe the Calamities which
attend human nature even in the greatest dignities of Life.
Her majesty was labouring under a fit of the Gout, and in
extream pain and agony, and on this occasion every thing
about her was much in the same disorder as about the meanest
of her subjects. Her face, which was red and spotted, was
rendered something frightful by her negligent dress, and the
foot affected was tied up with a pultis and some nasty bandages.
I was much affected at this sight, and the more <i>when she had
occasion to mention her people of Scotland</i>, which she did frequently
to the Duke. What are you, poor meanlike Mortal, thought
I, who talks in the style of a Soveraign? Nature seems to be
inverted when a poor infirm Woman becomes one of the Rulers
of the World, but, as Tacitus observes, it is not the first time
that Women have governed in Britain, and indeed they have
sometimes done this to better purpose than the Men.</p>

<p>But to return to the Treaty of Union, the Articles were at
last agreed to, sign'd, and sealed, by all the Commissioners,
the 22 of July 1706. They were afterwards presented to the
Queen at her palace of S<sup>t</sup> James, before a very numerous
Assembley.</p>

<p>The common people now screw'd up to a pitch, and ripe for
the mischief designed, and prompted by the particular agents
of a wicked party, began to be very insolent: It had been
whispered about several days, that the rabble would rise, and
come up to the Parliament House; and cry No Union; that
they would take away the Honours, as they call them, viz. the
Crown etc., and carry them to the Castle, and a long variety
of foolish reports of this kind. But the first appearance of
anything mobish was, that every day, when the Duke<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> went
up, but principally as he came down in his chair from the
House, the mob follow'd him, shouting and crying out, <span class="smcap">God</span>
bless his Grace, for standing up against the Union, and
appearing for his country, and the like.... On the 22nd of
October, they follow'd the Duke's chair quite thro the city
down to the Abbey Gate; the guards prevented their going
further; but all the way as they came back, they were heard to
threaten what they would do the next day; that then they would
be a thousand times as many; that they would pull the traitors,
so they called the treaters of the Union at London, out of their
houses, and they would soon put an end to the Union.</p>

<p>On the 23rd they made part of their words good indeed; for,
as the Parliament sat something late, the people gather'd in
the streets, and about the doors of the Parliament House, and
particularly the Parliament Close was almost full, that the
members could not go in or out without difficulty; when Duke
Hamilton was coming out of the House, the mob huzza'd as
formerly, and follow'd his chair in a very great number; the
Duke, instead of going down to the Abbey as usual, went up
the High Street to the Land-Market,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> as they call it, and so to
the lodgings of the Duke of Athole; some said, he went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
avoid the mob; others maliciously said, he went to point them
to their work.</p>

<p>While he went in to the Duke of Athole's lodgings, the rabble
attended at the door; and, by shouting and noise, having
increased their numbers to several thousands, they began with
Sir Patrick Johnston, who was one of the treaters, and the
year before had been Lord Provost; first they assaulted his
lodgings with stones and sticks, and curses not a few; but his
windows being too high, they came up the stairs to his door,
and fell to work at it with sledges, or great hammers; and,
had they broke it open in their first fury, he had, without
doubt, been torn in pieces without mercy; and thus
only, because he was a treater in the commission to England;
for, before that, no man was so well belov'd, as he, over the
whole city.</p>

<p>His lady, in the utmost despair with this fright, comes to the
window, with two candles in her hand, that she might be
known; and cried out, for <span class="smcap">God's</span> sake, to call the guards; an
honest apothecary in the town, who knew her voice, and saw
the distress she was in, and to whom the family, under <span class="smcap">God</span>, is
obliged, for their deliverance, ran immediately down to the
town guard; but they would not stir, without the Lord
Provost's order; but that being soon obtain'd, one Captain
Richardson, who commanded, taking about thirty men with
him, march'd bravely up to them; and making his way with
great resolution thro the crowd, they flying, but throwing
stones, and hallowing at him, and his men, he seized the foot
of the stair case; and then boldly went up, clear'd the stair,
and took six of the rabble in the very act; and so delivered the
gentleman and his family....</p>

<p>The city was now in a terrible fright, and every body was
under concern for their friends; the rabble went raving about
the streets till midnight, frequently beating drums, and raising
more people; when my Lord Commissioner being informed,
there were a thousand of the seamen and rabble come up from
Leith; and apprehending, if it were suffered to go on, it might
come to a dangerous head, and be out of his power to suppress,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
he sent for the Lord Provost, and demanded, that the Guards
should march into the city.</p>

<p>The Lord Provost, after some difficulty, yielded; tho it was
alleged, that it was what was never known in Edinburgh before.
About one o clock in the morning, a battalion of the Guards
entered the town, marched up to the Parliament Close, and
took post in all the avenues of the city, which prevented the
resolutions taken to insult the houses of the rest of the treaters.</p>

<p>The rabble were intirely reduc'd by this, and gradually
dispers'd, and so the tumult ended....</p>

<p>The author of this<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> had his share in the danger of this
tumult, and tho unknown to him, was watch'd and set by the
mob, in order to know where to find him, had his chamber
windows insulted, and the windows below him broken by
mistake. But, by the prudence of his friends, the shortness of
its continuance, and <span class="smcap">God's</span> providence, he escaped.</p>

<p>It is not to be doubted, but the Parliament of England would
give a kind reception to the articles of the Union as passed in
Scotland, when they were laid before that House, as was
evident from the quick dispatch in approving of and ratifying
the same; and so the Union commenced on the first of May
1707, a day never to be forgot by Scotland; a day in which the
Scots were stripped of what their predecessors had gallantly
maintained for many hundred years, I mean the independency
and soveraignty of the kingdom, both which the Earl of Seafield
so little valued, that when he, as Chancellor, signed the
engrossed exemplification of the Act of Union, he returned it
to the clerk, in the face of Parliament, with this dispising and
contemning remark, "Now there's ane end of ane old song."</p>

<p>The Earl of Mar, then at London, not finding how to form
his own interest at court, had resolved on those wicked and
traitorous measures he afterwards followed; and in order to
raise and carry on the rebellion, had, by some means or other,
received from abroad, no less than the sum of one hundred
thousand pounds sterling, together with letters and instructions
under the Pretender's own hand, and a commission appointing
him Lieutenant-General and Commander in Chief of his forces,
as he called them, in Scotland: And fearing lest his traitorous
designs against his lawful sovereign prince,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to whom he had
so early and solemnly promised fidelity, might possibly be
discovered, and he himself secured by the government, he
resolved to make a sudden tour into Scotland, as the likeliest
mean to prevent this fate, and in order to make some speedy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
advances in this his pernicious and bloody undertaking.
Wherefore on the 2nd of August, or as some say, the 1st, in
the evening, his lordship, in the dress of a private person,
embark'd with Major-General Hamilton, Colonel Hay, and
two servants on board of a collier in the Thames, and arriving
in two or three days at Newcastle, hired there a vessel
belonging to one Spence, which set him and his company on
shore in the Ely, from whence he got over to Creil<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in the
shire of Fife. Soon after his landing he was attended by
Sir Alexander Areskine, Lord Lyon, and others of his friends
in Fife, to whom he made known the design of his coming, and
then went forward to Kinoul, where he staid on Wednesday
the 17th, and on the 18th he passed the river Tay, about two
miles from Perth, with 40 horse on his way to the north.
Next day he sent letters to all the Jacobites round the country,
inviting them to meet him in haste at Brae-Mar, where he
arrived on Saturday the 20th of August.</p>

<p>There is no room to doubt, that he had before-hand concerted
measures with them; and that they were previously advised of
his coming, before he arrived in Scotland: For, on Saturday
the 6th of August, their friends at Edinburgh were apprized of
it; and early next morning Captain John Dalziel, a half-pay
officer, who, in view of this rebellion had thrown up his commission
to the Earl of Orkney, was sent out to give the alarm
to his brother, the Earl of Carnwath, then at Elliock, where he
arrived that night; and, early next morning, expresses were
sent to the Earl of Nithsdale, the Viscount of Kenmure, and
others of their friends in those parts; the Earl himself went
down that same day to meet them, in order to forward their
measures; and after some time spent in preparing others,
whose inclinations they knew, to embark with them in that
bloody project, they repaired to Lothian; and 'twas then given
out, that they were gone to a hunting in the north. This was
indeed a plausible pretence for their getting to the Highlands,
and the more that the Earl of Mar, to cover his design, too
black to be owned at the first, in calling the chiefs of the clans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
together, had proposed a hunting in his own country. Accordingly,
in a few days after he arrived at Brae-Mar, he was there
attended by a great number of gentlemen, of the best quality
and interest of all his party: And particularly at their Great
Council, which was held about August 26, there appeared the
Marquis of Huntley, eldest son to the Duke of Gordon; the
Marquis of Tullibardine, eldest son to the Duke of Athol; the
Earls of Nithsdale, Marischal, Traquair, Errol, Southesk,
Carnwath, Seaforth, Linlithgow, and several others; the
Viscounts of Kilsith, Kenmure, Kingston and Stormount; the
Lords Rollo, Duffus, Drummond, Strathallan, Ogilvie and
Nairn, with a good many gentlemen of interest in the Highlands,
amongst whom were the two Generals, Hamilton and
Gordon, Glenderule, Auldbair, Auchterhouse, Glengary, and
others from the clans....</p>

<p>... Moreover, we are told, that he shew'd them the letters
he had received from Lorraine, under the Pretender's own
hand, promising to come over to them in person, and put
himself upon the valour and fidelity of his Scots subjects; and
that in the mean time, they should be sure of ships, with arms,
ammunition, and all military stores, with officers, engineers,
and volunteers, as soon as they could give him an account to
what port they would direct them to be sent: As also, that he
shew'd them his commission under the Pretender's own hand,
appointing him Lieutenant-General, Commander in Chief, and
Director of the War; and assur'd them, that he was furnish'd
with money, and would, from time to time, be supplied with
sufficient sums to levy men, and to pay the troops regularly
that should be raised; so as no gentlemen should be at any
expence to subsist their men, but that both they, and the
country should be eased of all such burthens.</p>

<p>With these and other such arguments, which he proposed
unto them with a popular air, he at length prevailed upon
them to embrace his project; and some say, they engaged by
oath to stand by him, and one another, and to bring over their
friends and dependants to do the like. However, the noblemen
and gentlemen did not immediately after this meeting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
draw together their men, but went every man back to his own
estate, to take their measures for appearing in arms, when they
should hear again from the Earl of Mar, who remain'd, in the
mean time, in his own country, with some few attendants only.
These noblemen and gentlemen being returned home, began to
draw together their servants and dependants, in all the places
where they had interest, making several pretences for doing so,
but did not discover the real design till things were in readiness
to break out. And indeed it was but a few days after, that the
Earl of Mar summon'd them all, at least such as were near at
hand, to a general meeting at Aboyne in Aberdeenshire, on the
third of September, in order to concert farther measures for
their appearing in arms: And having there directed the
drawing together their forces without any loss of time, he
returned to Brae-Mar, and continued some days gathering the
people, till their number was increased considerably; but the
accounts being so various, while some say there were then two
thousand men, most of them horse, and others but sixty, I shall
not condescend on the particular number: However, with
those he had got together, he set up the Pretender's Standard
at Brae-Mar, on the sixth of September, 1715, and there
proclaim'd him King of Scotland, England, France, and
Ireland, etc. 'Tis reported, that when this standard was first
erected, the ball on the top of it fell off, which the superstitious
Highlanders were very much concern'd at, taking it as an
omen of the bad success of the cause for which they were then
appearing, and indeed, the event has proven that it was no less.
Thereafter they went to a small town named Kirkmichael,
where having proclaim'd the Pretender, and summon'd the
people to attend his standard, they staid some few days, and
then proceeded to Moulin, another small town in the shire of
Perth, where they likewise proclaim'd him, and rested some
short time, gathering their forces; and where by the coming
in of others of their party, their number was considerably
increased.</p>

<p>In the mean time it must be confessed that their courage
and conduct in Scotland far exceeded what was expected, for
the Earl of Mar had so much address as to bring to the town
of Perth, the center of all the enterprise, at least 10,000 men,
some have carried the number to 12,000, which <i>I</i> am inclined
to believe, provided the 1600 men be included that past the
Frith of Forth near the Island of May, of which hereafter.</p>

<p>During these convulsions in my native country, I was
obliged to change my course of living and turn a military
man, for being appointed one of the Lieutenants of the Shire
of Edin., I was obliged to act my part in bringing the militia
together. These consisted of a few men, horse and foot, who
never continued 3 days together, and signified nothing in the
military way, the lowland men being a great deal more unfit for
warlike expeditions than the Highlanders who had joined the
Earl of Mar. However, with these militia troops we sometimes
made a show, and perhaps they served to intimidate
those who knew nothing about them. They were particularly
useful and active when the Highlanders above mentioned past
the Forth and were marching to take possession of Edin., for
being drawn up on the high way a mile east of Edin., where
these Highlanders were to march in order to take possession
of the town, they found themselves obliged to turn to the right
and take possession of the citadel of Lieth, the &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> of October,
1715.</p>

<p>That same night, to the joy of the inhabitants of Edin.,
who expected to be plundered by the Highlanders, the Duke
of Argyll arrived from Stirling with 200 chosen foot and
300 dragoons, the foot mounted on country horses for more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
expedition. Next morning the Deputy Lieutenants and all the
well affected to the Government of K. George waited on him,
and immediately he ordered all his troops to march down with
him to the attaque of the Citadel of Lieth.</p>

<p>I waited on his Grace, and we never halted till we were
within 300 paces of that place. Here all our men were drawn
up in 2 lines for the attaque. The foot in the center, and the
horse on the wings, our number was as follows. 300 Dragoons,
200 Regular foot, about 200 of the Town Guards of Edin.,
and about 500 volunteers, with a regiment of militia. These
amounting in all to about 1500 men, were drawn up on the
crofts to the westward of the citadel. There were likeways
two regiments of militia from the shires of Merse and Teviotdale,
who were drawn up on the Links on the south side of the
town to prevent the Highlanders from escaping.</p>

<p>The Duke called a Council of War, consisting of the
principal officers present, in sight of the enemy, here it was
debated in what manner to attaque the citadel, for the duke
had never seen it, and the issue was that in regard we had
neither cannon, bombs, nor granads, it was impossible to do
anything to purpose, for that our men would be destroied by
the fire of the enemy before they came near the ramparts, for
altho' these ramparts and bastions were ruined ever since the
days of Oliver Cromwell, who about the years 1654 and 1655
ordered them to be repaired out of the old fortifications of
Lieth, yet they were sufficient against such a body of men
as we were who came there to attaque them. On these
considerations we were obliged to return to the town in a very
disconsolet manner.</p>

<p>The Duke might have been informed of the condition of
that place before he marched there, but he thought nothing
in Scotland, except castles, impregnable to his troops, and we
who knew the citadel never doubted but dismounted Dragoons
cou'd force the place sword in hand. The next thing to be
done was to provide artillery from the Castle of Edin., in order
to attaque the citadel next day, but that night the Highlanders,
who were under the command of one Brigadier Macintosh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
marched off to Seaton House, where they staid 3 or 4 days.
Here several detachments were sent out of Edin. to attaque
them, but being without cannon we cou'd do nothing.</p>

<p>All our troops being now assembled, the Earl of Mar resolved
to march towards the enemy, and on the eighth of November
arrived at Denain,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> with fourteen battalions of foot and eight
squadrons of horse, having left three battalions in Perth for the
defence of the place; the ninth the army lay at Auchterarder,
where he reviewed the troops, who consisted of about 6000 foot
and eight hundred horse. Here we lay two days, waiting for
two battalions from Fife; but finding these did not come up
so soon as we expected, the twelfth we continued our march,
the advanced guard lay near Dumblain, and the rest of the
troops were quarter'd about a mile behind them, the want of
tents and the coldness of the weather rendering it impossible
for us to encamp. We had as yet no perfect account of the
motions of the enemy, and concluded from the inferiority of
their number (they being not above 3000 foot and twelve
hundred horse), that they would fight us at the passage of the
river, but we had hardly got the troops marched to their
different quarters, when we received orders to join with all
haste our advanced guard, the Duke of Argile having passed
the Forth, and encamped about the toun of Dumblain, within
cannon shot of them. Both armies lay all night on their arms,
and next morning by day break we discover'd a body of the
enemies on a rising ground near our left. Before eight in the
morning, our army was formed in order of battle, in two lines,
without any body of reserve. The Earl of Mar call'd all the
general officers and heads of clans to a council of war, which
was held at the head of the line, and there asked their advice
whither we should attack the enemy, or return to Perth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wait the arrival of King James, who was every day expected,
as also for accounts what success our friends in England might
have; but it was carried almost unanimously to attack, none
daring openly to oppose the current; the Marquis of Huntly
only made some insinuations that it would not be fit to remain
in unaction till the King's arrival.</p>

<p>The resolution being now taken to attack the enemy, the
Earl of Mar commanded the Earl Marischal, with Sir Donald
M'Donald's regiment of foot, and his own squadron of horse, to
take possession of the rising ground on which a body of the
enemies horse still remain'd, and to cover the march of the
army on the left (our right being cover'd by a river) to the toun
of Dumblain, where we imagined the enemy still to be. On
our approach, the enemies horse retired; and we had no sooner
gained the top of the hill than we discover'd their whole body,
marching without beat of drum, about two musket shot from
us. It was now too late to retreat; we therfor form'd on the
top of the hill, and the Earl Marischal sent an aid-de-camp to
advertise the Earl of Mar that he was fallen in with the
enemies army, that it was impossible for him to bring off
the foot, and therfor desired he would march up to his
assistance as quick as possible,&mdash;which he did even in too
much haste; for the army, which marched in four columns,
arrived in such confusion that it was impossible to form them
according to the line of battle projected, every one posted
himself as he found ground, and one column of foot enclining
to the right and another to the left of the Earl Marischal's
squadron of horse, that regiment which should have been on
the right, found itself in the center, separated from the rest of
the horse, and opposed to the enemies foot; our foot formed
all in one line, except on the left, where a bog hinder'd them
from extending themselves, and encreased the confusion.</p>

<p>The Duke of Argile was no less embarrassed on his side.
His army was not yet entirely formed; the rear, which was to
have formed his left wing, was yet on their march, and showed
us their flanck, which being observed by Lieutenant General
Gordon, he order'd our troops immediately to charge, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they did with so much vigour that in less than ten minutes they
entirely defeated six regiments of foot and five squadrons of
dragoons, which composed more than the half of the Duke's
army, while the rest having taken the same advantage of our
left, which had neither time nor ground to fire, entirely routed
them. Both parties pursued the troops they had broken, not
knowing what had happen'd on the other side, till at length the
Earl of Mar, having had the fatal news of the loss we had
receiv'd, order'd the troops to give over the pursuit, and having
rallied them, returned to the field of battle, from whence we
discover'd the enemy posted at the foot of the hill amongst
mud walls, on the same ground where we had layen the night
before.</p>

<p>The Earl of Mar sent immediately an officer to reconnoitre
them, and at the same time assembled the General officers and
heads of clans, to consult whether he should attack them again;
but the officer having reported that their numbers were equal
to ours, and the Highlanders, who were extreamly fatigued,
and had eat nothing in two days, being averse to it, it was
resolved to keep the field of battle, and to let the enemy retire
unmolested, which they had already began to do under cover
of the earth walls, as well as of the night which was now
approaching, leaving us about fifty prisoners of ours, most of
them wounded, whom they had not time to carry along with
them. We continued on the field of battle till dark night, and
then marched back to the same villages which had been marked
for our quarters the night before.</p>

<p>The enemy had about seven hundred men killed or wounded,
amongst whom was the Earl of Forfar killed, and the Earl of
Islay wounded, and two hundred and twenty-three taken
prisoners, and we had about 150 killed or wounded, and
eighty-two taken; but among those killed we had three
persons of note, the Earl of Strathmore, his unkle Auchterhouse,
and Clanronald, and the Earl of Panmure very much
wounded. The loss of colours was almost equal on both sides;
but the enemy got five piece of our cannon, which we could
not carry off, those belonging to the train having run away with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the horses when they saw our left broke; and thus ended the
affair of Dumblain, in which neither side gained much honour,
but which was the entire ruin of our party.</p>

<p>Some unlucky mistakes which happened that day, must here
take place; first, an order to the whole horse on the left to march
to the right, which so discouraged the foot of that wing to see
themselves abandoned, that to it may be attributed their shameful
behaviour that day; nor were these horse of any advantage to
us where they were posted, for the ground was so bad that they
could never be brought to engage. Another, of no less consequence,
was the mistake of the officer who was sent to
reconnoitre the Duke of Argile's army in the afternoon, for he
having taken his remarks more by the number of colours than
the space of ground they occupied, made his report that the
enemy was betwixt two and three thousand foot strong, when
in reality there was no more than three battalions, not making
in all above one thousand foot, the other colours being what the
Duke had just taken on our left, and being almost the same
with his own, he now used them to disguise the weakness of
his troops by making a show of four battalions more than he
had, the ground and mud walls by which he was cover'd not
allowing to see that he had formed only two ranks deep; this
mistake hinder'd us from attacking him in the evening, which
it's probable we might have done with better success than we
had in the morning.</p>

<p>Next morning the Duke of Mar, finding most of our left had
run quite away and was not yet returned, retired towards
Perth, as the enemy had already done into Stirling.</p>

<p>Before these had come to Huntlie,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the King was already

[December], and was in his road to Fetteresso, where he
halted. We were not long of hearing from those who came
from the South that a young gentleman had passed Aberdeen
with Captain Allan Cameron; that they had gone straight to
Fetteresso, and it was thought that young man was the King;
Cameron was gone on post to Perth, and the other was left at
Fetteresso privately. This made Huntlie send a gentleman
to Aberdeen with orders to go on till he got the certain account.
By the time he got there, he was certainly informed the King
was arrived, and that Mar was already at Fetteresso. To do
Huntlie justice, being present when he received the news, he
said, "Now ther's no help for it, we must all ruin with him:
would to God he had comed sooner." There seem'd still some
faint hopes to remain, which were, that since his Majestie had
stopt at Fetteresso, and keept himself incognito there for two
days, till Captain Cameron had informed Mar of his arrival,
his reason for it could only be that he wanted to know the
state of his affairs before he'd go forward to Perth; for what
other reason could have hinder'd him to [have] declared himself
at Aberdeen, or from going straight to Perth? And by
all that could be learned since, we found we judged right; for
it's said, that if his affairs were on a bad foot, he was resolved
to return without loss of time, and leave his poor subjects the
freedom of making terms for themselves; a very just and
reasonable thought. Whatever was in it, as his declaring
himself at Fetteresso, and afterwards going up to Perth, put
a stop to all thoughts of terms on our side, so it's not to be
doubted that the Government, however inclinable they might
[have] been before, could ever entertain or allow of any such
proposals from those inclined to mercy, or the moderate people
of their own side....</p>

<p>My Lord Mar, who, as we first supposed, would [have] met
his Majesty privately, spread the news at Perth of the King's
happy landing, and brought a numerous train with him to
Fetteresso, out of a view, I believe, to put it out of his
Majesty's power to go back, having already published his
being there; and to confirm him of the certainty of his affairs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
succeeding, by the approbation of those villainous, weak, miserable,
deluded dependers of his Lordship, who he brought along
with him.</p>

<p>... Thus that unhappy Prince, entirely a stranger to his
own affairs, as much as he had dropt out of another world,
or from the clouds, as things stood, was brought in eminent
danger of his life, without its being possible that it could have
any other effect but that of the certain ruin of his friends, and
driving the nail to the head, and riveting the misery of those
who had so generously sacrificed all to serve him. It's certain
that he was made believe that his affairs in general were on
a good foot, at least, very retrievable; that there were twice
as many in Perth as there really were; and that there was no
more needful to be done but the taking of Inverness, which
entirely depended on Huntlie; and when that was done, the
King would have a great army from all places of the Highlands
before the Duke of Argyle could attack Perth. As for powder,
I suppose it was never spoke of, since there was no want of it
at Fetteresso; that the news of his Majestie's arrival would no
sooner spread but all would return, and great numbers who
had joined them would come from different corners.... The
King was carried triumphinglie up to Perth.</p>

<p>... His Grace<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> having received positive orders from Court,
to march forthwith against the rebels, he resolved to surmount
all difficulties, and to march as soon as the artillery, and some
of the Dutch forces at Edinburgh, and the regiments of Newton
and Stanhope, who were quartered at Glasgow, could come up
to join him; which they did, two or three days after....
The news of these preparations and march were not grateful
to His Majesty at Scone, spoiling the ceremony of his coronation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and meeting of his Parliament: Instead of which fine
things, the only matter now under consideration was, how to
provide for their own safety; and the grand question debated
was, whether to maintain the place, and fight the Duke of
Argyle, or retreat.... The Pretender, finding that time was
not to be lost, retired that evening from Scone to Perth, where
having supped at Provost Hay's, he rested some hours; and
next morning<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> about ten o'clock, the rebels abandoned Perth,
marching over the Tay upon the ice, and, leaving their cannon
behind them, took their rout towards Dundee. About noon
the Pretender himself, with the Earl of Mar, followed his
flying adherents with tears in his eyes, complaining that
instead of bringing him to a Crown, they had brought him
to his grave....</p>

<p>The rebels having retired from Dundee to Montrose, his
Grace, on the 3rd,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> sent a detachment towards Aberbrothick<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
within eight miles of that place; and on the fourth, in the
morning, ordered Major General Sabine, with 3 battalions,
500 detached foot, and 50 dragoons, to march to Aberbrothick.
The same day his Grace detached Colonel Clayton with 300 foot
and 50 dragoons, to march by the way of Brechin; giving orders
to the one as well as the other to summon the country people
to remove the snow on the roads, which, being then very deep,
made their march very heavy and tedious. His Grace having
divided the rest of his army into two bodies, for marching with
the greater expedition; and the rebel army having marched in
two columns, on the 5th, in the morning, General Cadogan
with the infantry marched towards Aberbrothick, and at the
same time the Duke himself, with all the cavalry, proceeded
by the Upper Road towards Brechin; the whole army being
to join the next day at Stonehive,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> intending on Tuesday hereafter
to be at Aberdeen, to which place they supposed the
Pretender was gone.</p>

<p>But by this time the Pretender was out of their reach; for
having received advice at Montrose, on the 4th of February,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
about four in the afternoon, that part of the King's army was
advancing towards Aberbrothick, he ordered the clans who
remained with him to be ready to march, about eight at night,
towards Aberdeen, where he assured them a considerable force
would soon come to them from France. At the hour appointed
for their march, the Pretender ordered his horses to be brought
before the door of the house in which he lodged, and the guard
which usually attended him to mount, as if he designed to go
on with the clans to Aberdeen; but at the same time he slipped
privately out on foot, accompanied only by one of his domesticks,
went to the Earl of Mar's lodgings, and from thence, by a byway
to the water-side, where a boat waited and carried him and the
Earl of Mar on board a French ship of 90 tuns, called the
<i>Maria Teresa</i> of St. Malo. About a quarter of an hour after,
two other boats carried the Earl of Melford and the Lord
Drummond, with Lieutenant-General Sheldon and ten other
gentlemen on board the same ship, and then they hoisted sail
and put to sea; and notwithstanding of his Majesty's ships
that were cruising on that coast, got safely off, and in seven
days landed at Waldam, near Graveling,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> between Dunkirk
and Calais. The Earls Marischal, Southesk, the Lord Tinmouth,
General Gordon, with many other gentlemen and officers
of distinction, were left behind to shift for themselves, who kept
with the army, and continued their march towards Aberdeen,
the foot marching on before with General Gordon, and the
Earl Marischal, with about 1000 horse, keeping the rear to
prevent surprise....</p>

<p>The same day the King's forces advanced to Montrose, the
remains of the rebel army arrived at Aberdeen, where General
Gordon showed them a letter from the Pretender, in which he
acquainted his friends that the disappointments he had met
with, especially from abroad, had obliged him to leave that
country; that he thanked them for their services, and desired
them to advise with General Gordon, and consult their own
security either by keeping in a body or separating, and encouraging
them to expect to hear farther from him in a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
short time.... And we are told, that upon reading of the
letter, many of the people threw down their arms, crying out
they were basely betrayed, they were all undone, they were
left without king or general. On the seventh, in the morning,
the van of the rebels marched from Aberdeen, as did their
rear about two in the afternoon, and their main body lay at
Old Meldrum that night; but about 200 of their horse, amongst
whom were many of their chiefs, with Irish and other officers
who came lately from France, went toward Peterhead in order
to ship themselves off in ships which they knew were waiting
for them there....</p>

<p>Their main body marched straight west, through Strath-Spey
and Strath-Don to the hills of Badenoch, where they separated:
The foot dispersed into the mountains on this side of Lochy,
and the horse went Lochquhaher, agreeing, however, to meet
again upon notice from the Pretender. And here being advised
that two French frigates were come for their relief, and would
lay in Pentland Firth till they should hear from them, the
Lord Duffus, Sir George Sinclair, General Eckline and others,
about 160 gentlemen in all, well mounted on horseback, made
a sally from the hills, and crossing the shire of Murray,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> came
to the seaside near Burgh, where they got several large barks
which carried them to the Orkneys, Arskerry,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and other of the
islands, from whence most of them found means to get into the
frigates which carried them safe to France. Other ships
coming afterwards carried the rest to Gottenburg, in the
Swedish dominions, where some of them took on in that king's
service.... There were yet with the rebels in Scotland
many of their chiefs, as the Marquis of Tullibardine, the Earls
Marischal, Southesk, Linlithgow, and Seaforth, who having
broke his submission, joined them again in their flight to the
northward, the Lord Tinmouth, Sir Donald M'Donald, and
several others of the heads of the clans, who sheltered themselves
for some time in the mountains from his Majesty's
troops who pursued them through the north; and from thence
some made their escape to the Isle of Sky, the Lewis, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
other of the north-western islands till ships came for their
relief to carry them abroad; and some of them afterwards
submitted to the Government, as we shall hear below....</p>

<p>The Duke of Argyle having thus gloriously finished the
most laborious and hard campaign that ever was known, he
left the command of his Majesty's troops to Lieutenant-General
Cadogan and returned to Edinbourgh the 27th of
February, and in a day or two after set out for London, where
he arrived on the 6th of March.</p>

Correspondence from the Year 1625 to 1678 ... the Whole published

<p>An anonymous letter, written by Mr. Duncan Forbes to
Sir Robert Walpole, most likely in August 1716&mdash;a copy is
extant (from which the present is taken) in the President's
handwriting.</p>

<p>Sir, ... When the late Rebellion was happily ended by the
Pretender's flight, his deluded followers found themselves all
in chains, or obliged to surrender and sue for mercy, or to fly
their country with him. Every man concerned in that odious
work certainly deserved death, and the punishment due by
law; but humanity and prudence forbade it. It was not fit to
dispeople a country; nor prudent to grieve the King's best
friends, who mostly had some concern in those unfortunate
men; or expedient to give too just grounds of clamour to the
disaffected.</p>

<p>It will be agreed on all hands, that the proper rule in this
case would have been, to have punished only as many as was
necessary for terror, and for weakening the strength of the
rebels for the future; and to extend mercy to as many as it
could conveniently be indulged to with the security of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Government; and this maxim every thinking Whig had then
in his mouth, however offended at the insolences of the rebels.
In place of a course of this kind, the method followed was, 1st,
to try all the criminals in England; 2dly, to detain in prison
all those in custody in Scotland, except some who had interest
with certain great men to obtain a previous pardon, to the
manifest dishonour of the Government; 3dly, to attaint a vast
number of Scots noblemen and gentlemen; 4thly, to put it out
of his Majesty's power to grant any part of estates forfeited;
and 5thly, to appoint a Commission for enquiry, and levying
the rebels' goods and chattels. The necessary consequences of
this procedure in general are two; first, it makes all those who
had the misfortune to be seduced into the rebellion, with their
children, relatives, and such as depend on them, forever
desperate; and it's hard to tell what occasions may offer for
venting their rage. We see that want and hard circumstances
lead men daily into follies, without any other temptation; but
when those circumstances are brought on by adherence to any
principle, or opinion, it's certain the sufferers will not quit
their attempts to better their condition, but with their lives.
2d, as there are none of the rebels who have not friends among
the King's faithful subjects, it is not easy to guess how far a
severity of this kind, unnecessarily pushed, may alienate the
affections even of those from the Government. But in
particular, as this case relates to Scotland, the difficulty will be
insurmountable. I may venture to say, there are not 200
gentlemen in the whole kingdom who are not very nearly
related to some one or other of the rebels. Is it possible that
a man can see his daughter, his grandchildren, his nephews, or
cousins, reduced to beggary and starving unnecessarily by a
Government, without thinking very ill of it; and where this is
the case of a whole nation, I tremble to think what dissatisfactions
it will produce against a settlement so necessary
for the happiness of Britain.</p>

<p>If all the rebels, with their wives, children, and immediate
dependants, could be at once rooted out of the earth, the shock
would be astonishing; but time would commit it to oblivion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and the danger would be less to the Constitution, than when
thousands of innocents, punished with misery and want for the
offences of their friends, are suffered to wander about the
country, sighing out their complaints to Heaven, and drawing
at once the compassion and moving the indignation of every
human creature.</p>

Gentleman here, to his Friend Abroad</i>, p. 65, by J. Macky. Second
edition. (London: 1729.)</p></div>


<p>The High-Street of Edinburgh, running by an easy ascent
from the Netherbow to the Castle, a good half mile, is doubtless
the stateliest street in the world, being broad enough for five
coaches to drive up abreast; and the houses on each side are
proportionately high to the broadness of the street; all of
them six or seven story high, and those mostly of free stone,
makes this street very august.</p>

<p>Half way up this street stands St. Giles's Church, the ancient
cathedral of this city, in the form of a cross; but since the
Reformation it is turned into four convenient churches, by
partitions, called the High-Kirk, the Old-Kirk, the Tolbooth-Kirk,
and Haddock's Hole. A-top of this church is erected a
large open cupola, in the shape of an imperial crown, that is a
great ornament to the city, and seen at a great distance. King
David erected a copy after this over St. Nicholas's Church in
Newcastle, but it does not near come up to it. Besides these
four churches of St. Giles's, there is in the same street a little
lower the Trone<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Church, built after the model of Inigo Jones's
St. Paul's Covent Garden; a very handsome church at the
east end of the lake, called the Collegiate Church, built by
Mary of Gelder,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Queen to James the Second; a church built
by a Lady Yester, a handsome new church in the middle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the Canongate, and two good churches under the same roof at
the Grey-Friars. There are also some chapels; but they are
converted into halls for trades.</p>

<p>To the south of St. Giles's Church is a fine square, with an
equestrian statue of King Charles the Second in the middle.
In this square stands the Parliament-House, where their
parliaments were kept: Also the Council and Treasury, and
all other publick offices. It's a fine modern building of free-stone,
finished by Charles the First in 1636. Underneath this
building is kept the lawyer's library<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; where there is a fine
collection of books, of medals, and of ancient coins, the largest
of English and Scots coins I ever saw. I could not perceive
that the Scots bore the lion rampant in a tressor of Flower-de-Luces<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
on the coins, till the Stewarts.</p>

<p>Joining to this library is the Register, where are kept all
the deeds and securities of the nation, as a common bank.
Here is also a very good bank for money,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> whose notes go
current all over the nation. There is also a fine room in this
square for the meeting of the royal boroughs, adorned with
pictures.</p>

<p>In this great street are several stone fountains of water,
brought in pipes at three miles distance, disposed at convenient
distances to supply the whole city with water; and on each
side of this street are lanes, or wynds as they are called here,
that run down to the bottom.</p>

<p>This made an English gentleman, that was here with the
Duke of York, merrily compare it to a double wooden comb,
the great street the wood in the middle, and the teeth of each
side the lanes.</p>

<p>These lanes lead you to a street below, called the Cowgate,
which runs the whole length east and west of the other, but is
neither half so broad or well built. The High Street is also
the best paved street I ever saw. I will not except Florence.
One would think the stones inlaid; they are not half a foot
square; and notwithstanding the coaches and carts, there is
not the least crack in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>South from the Cowgate lies the High-School for Latin, and
in its yard is kept a fine bagnio, in a handsome neat house,
built for the Company of Surgeons; and in their hall is the
picture of the late Duke Hamilton, Earl Finlater in his
Chancellor's robes, and of all the eminent surgeons of the
town, to the number of about forty, all originals, by Sir John
Medina. There is also a pretty garden before and behind the
house. Directly north from this, on the other side of the
Cowgate, is the Physicians Hall and garden, where they have
a noble museum, founded by Sir Andrew Balfour, physician.
The learned and industrious Sir Robert Sebald has very much
augmented it. It contains a treasure of curiosities of art and
nature, foreign and domestick, as appears by Sir Robert's
account, printed in four books in 1697.</p>

<p>A little further to the south of the Cowgate is the University,
which consists only of one college: The Magistrates of
Edinburgh are governors of it; it hath a principal or warden,
and four philosophy regents or professors. There is also a
professor of Divinity, of Civil Law, of History, Mathematicks,
and Hebrew.</p>

<p>In studying four years at this college you commence Master
of Arts: The scholars are not in commons, and kept to strict
rules as in the colleges in England, nor wear gowns; they
lodge and diet in the town, as at the colleges in Holland, and
are required to attend at their several classes from eight in the
morning till twelve, and from two to four. I wonder how a
college in a town used to so much business and diversion to
take off from the study of youth, should ever produce a good
scholar.</p>

<p>This college consists of two lower courts, and one upper one,
tolerably well built; the upper court, to which you ascend by
steps of stairs, is larger than the other two. On the left of
that court is the library, a long spacious room, and the books
neatly kept, and cloistered with doors of wire, that none can
open but the keeper, more commodious than the multitude of
chains used in the English libraries. The several benefactions
are kept in distinct apartments, with the donor's name over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
them in gold letters; and over these cases of books are pictures
of most of the Kings of Scotland, and of all the reformers both
at home and abroad....</p>

<p>Joining to the College is a neat hospital for girls, with a
pretty garden, and bowling-green; and a little further is the
churchyard of the Grey-Friars, the burial-place of all the
eminent burghers of the city; for they don't affect so much as
the English to be buried in churches; that they think smells
too much of the Popish stamp....</p>

<p>To the westward of this church-yard stands the most
celebrated Hospital of George Herriot, Jeweller to James the
Sixth, for the bringing up of 130 poor boys, children of decayed
merchants and tradesmen of this city. The building exceeds
any thing of the kind in Europe. Sutton's Hospital, called the
Charter-House at London, is a noble foundation; but the house
neither of that, Christ-Church, nor anything of the kind at
Rome or Venice, comes up to the magnificence of this building;
which I suppose is owing to Dr. Balcanqual, his executor, who
was a great architect, was Dean of Rochester, and helped King
James the Sixth to write his Basilicon Doron, and was left in
full power by Mr. Herriot to build this hospital, which he
hath done more like a princely palace than a habitation for
necessitous children....</p>

<p>To the north of Herriot's work, from whence its fine avenue
ascends, and to the west of the Cowgate, is the Grass-Market,
like Smithfield at London, where they sell their horses, corn and
hay, and is as spacious as Smithfield is; and from it is the
West Port or Gate, out of which is a large suburb, as it is at
most of the others. The City of Edinburgh is a good English
mile from the Palace to the Castle in a direct line; and taking
in the suburbs called the West-Port, Bristol,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Paterrow,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Pleasants,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Canongate, and Calton, may be four miles in
circumference.</p>

<p>This Grass-Market, or Smithfield, lies directly under the
Castle, which is built on a high rock at the west end of the
city, and over-looks and commands it. The rock on which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
this castle is built is inaccessible on all sides, except just the
front from the town, which rises by an easy ascent on the ridge
of the hill all the way from the Palace: However, this front is
secured by a half-moon, at least 200 feet perpendicularly high,
well stored with artillery, besides other lower works towards
the gate, that make it impregnable. There is also a royal
palace in this castle, finely built of free-stone, with very noble
apartments; in one of which, King James the sixth of Scotland,
and first of England, was born. You may imagine the prospect,
very delicious and unbounded from such a height as this; for
you not only see all Edinburgh under you, but the whole course
of the firth from the Bass to Stirling; the coasts of Fife on the
other side of the sea, and many score miles into the country.</p>

<p>... To explain the reasons that now carried me to Spain,
its necessary to go back to the month of August of this year,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
when the English, without any previous declaration of war, or
even any good ground for it, had attacked the King of Spain's
fleet on the coast of Sicily, and entirely ruined it, which so
exasperated the Cardinal Alberoni, who then governed Spain
with the title of first Minister, that he resolv'd to assist King
James, and so revenge himself on the Whigs, who had been
the occasion of the breach of faith he complained of.... One
difficulty still remain'd,&mdash;which was to get the chiefs of the
King's friends, who were in France, advertised of this, which
the Cardinal desired me to undertake. The Earl Marischal
had brought with him from the Duke of Ormonde a little billet
containing these words&mdash;"Pray have entire confidence in the
bearer," and signed Ormond, to be given to him who should be
sent; and with this and about 18,000 crowns, I set out from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Madrid the 19 of February,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and three days after arrived at
St. Sebastian, where I deliver'd 12,000 crowns to the Prince
Campo Florido, for the equipment of the frigats destin'd for
Scotland, and with the little money which remain'd entered
France privately....</p>

<p>All things being now ready, we embark'd the 19th of March
in a small barck of about 25 tunns, in the mouth of the Seine,
and shaped our course to pass betwixt Dover and Calais, and
so round the Orkneys to the Isle of Lewis, which was our
place of rendezvous; but the wind continuing at east forced us
the Friday after, March 24, to alter our course, and stand away
for St. George's Channel, or the back of Ireland, as we should
think best.... From thence we stood for Cape Clear and the
west coast of Ireland, and after favourable but blowing
weather, arrived the 4 of April, N.S. in the isle of Lewis,
where we enquired if no ship had touched there lately from
Spain, or if there was no particular news in the country; but
finding them ignorant of any thing that could give us light into
what we wanted to be informed of, we remain'd there some
days, and at last had accounts that two frigats were come to an
anchor on the other side of the island, on which I went with
all haste there, not doubting but it was those we were longing
for. I found them already sailed, but a gentleman of the
country informed me that they were the same, and were gone
some miles farther to Stornoway, the only toun or rather
village on all the island. I went the same night there, and
found them in the harbour at an anchor, and the men still
aboard....</p>

<p>The Marquesses of Seafort and Tullibardine came and
joined us next day, and in the evening held a council of war to
resolve what was to be done. The Earl Marischal first asked
to know what commissions each had, that the command might
be regulated, and Lord Tullibardine not owning his late commissions,
the command remain'd in him as eldest Major
General. It was then disputed whether it was fit to go
immediately to the main land of Scotland, or to continue in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
island where we were till we had advice of the Duke of
Ormonde's landing in England. This last party was much
insisted on by Lord Tullibardine and Glenderuel, but all the
rest being against it, because we might easily be block'd up in
the isle by two or three of the enemies ships, it was resolved to
follow the project which the Earl Marischal had proposed to
the Cardinal, to land as soon as possible in Scotland, and with
the Spaniards and Highlanders who should first join us, march
straight to Inverness, in which there were not above 300 of the
enemies foot, who would be in no condition to oppose us, and
to remain there till we should be joined by such a body of
horse and foot as should put us in a condition of marching to
the more southern parts of the Kingdom. The council of war
being at an end, the Spanish troops were order'd to debark
that they might refraich themselves after a voyage of 42 days,
and it was resolved to sail for the main land three days
after....</p>

<p>We had no sooner debarked the troops and ammunition,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
than the Earl Marischal and Brigadier Campbel proposed
marching straight to Inverness with the Spaniards and 500
Highlanders, whom the Marquess of Seafort promised to give
us, to surprise the enemies garison, who as yet had no accounts
of us; but the same demon who had inspired them with the
design of staying in the Lewis, hinder'd them from accepting
this proposition. We were all in the dark what could be the
meaning of these dilatory proceedings, which was discover'd to
be the effects of the measures they had already taken, for
before the Earl Marischal's arrival, they (not knowing but that
he might have a commission superior to the Marquess of
Tullibardine's) had wrote letters in a circular manner to most
of their friends, acquainting them that it was the King's
intentions that no body should take arms till the Spanish
troops were landed in England; and therefore the Marquess
declared that till then he would not stir from where he was,
nor even allow any detachments to be made; and some days
after, finding that we had still no accounts of the Duke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Ormonde, nor of any movement in England, he proposed that
without further delay we should embark aboard the same
vessels and return to Spain, from which with great difficulty he
was dissuaded.</p>

<p>But the Earl Marischal, fearing that he might renew the
same design in case the news we expected was long a coming,
declared to him the day after that he was resolved to send the
two fregats immediately back to Spain, they being no longer in
safety where they were, for being already discover'd, it was
natural to believe that the Government of England would
immediately send ships to block them up, or to intercept them
in their passage home, and in spight of all the arts they used
to detain them, three days after they sailed; and indeed just in
time, for not a week after their departure arrived three English
men of war, much superior to ours both in force and equipage,
who, finding we had put most of our ammunition and provisions
into an old castel, situate on the shore, under the guard
of a detachment of 45 Spaniards, immediately began to batter
it from the three ships, and the same night obliged them to
surrender prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Our ships were no sooner sailed than the Marquess of
Tullibardine began to think of other measures. His retrait
out of the island was now impracticable in the manner he had
designed it, and now he resolved to draw what ships he could
together, but it was too late; he had given the enemy time to
draw troops not only from the remote parts of the Kingdom,
but even from Holland. The regiments of Kapell, May, and
Sturler, were already arrived, and his circular letters had given
those who were not very willing an excellent excuse, he himself
having already wrote to them that they should not take
arms.</p>

<p>Our affairs were in this condition, when we received the
news, of the entire dispersion of the Duke of Ormond's fleet;
but at the same time our friends assured us that all diligence
was using in Spain to put it in a condition to sail again that
same spring. This left us still some hopes, and therefore we
order'd the gentlemen who were nearest us to assemble their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
vassalls, but this last accident had disheartned them, that not
above a thousand men appeared, and even those seemed not
very fond of the enterprize.</p>

<p>The enemy was by this time within three days march of us,
with four regiments of foot, and a detachment of a fifth, and
150 dragoons, and waited only for the provisions which was
necessary to be carried along (into a country full of mountains
and possessed by the enemy,) to march to attack us in our post
which, by the situation, was strong enough had it been well
defended; our right was cover'd by a rivulet which was difficult
to pass, and our left by a ravine, and in the front the ground
was so rugged and steep that it was almost impossible to come
at us. However, the tenth of June the enemy appear'd at the
foot of the mountain, and after having reconnoitred the ground
he attacked a detachment we had posted on our right on the
other side of the rivulet commanded by Lord George Murray,
who not being succour'd as he ought, was obliged to retire, but
without any loss. At the same time our center was attacked
and forced with very little loss on either side; and after a
skirmish of about three hours, in which not above a hundred
men were killed or wounded on both sides, and of distinction
only the Marquess of Seafort wounded, our troops were forced
to retire to the top of the mountain, whose height hinder'd the
enemies pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> By this time it was night, which gave the
chiefs of our party time to consult what was to be done in this
urgency, and on considering that they had neither provisions
nor ammunition, that the few troops they had had behaved in
a manner not to give great encouragement to try a second
action, it was resolved, that the Spaniards should surrender,
and the Highlanders disperse. Don Nicolas Bolano, who
commanded the detachment of the regiment of Galicia, offer'd
to attack the enemy once more; but the general officers judging
the attempt in vain, the first resolution was followed, and
accordingly next morning the Spaniards surrender'd on condition
their baggage should not be plunder'd, and every body
else took the road he liked best. As I was then sick of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a feavour, I was forced to lurck some months in the mountains,
and in the beginning of September having got a ship,
I embarcked at Peterhead, and 4 days after landed in Hollande
at the Texel.</p>

Gentleman here, to his Friend Abroad</i>, p. 269, by J. Macky.
Second edition. (London: 1729.)</p></div>


<p>There is no nation where a man hath fairer play for his
liberty, than in Scotland: Here are no Sheriffs Officers, and
Marshal's men, that will whip you off the street at London,
and run you into a spunging-house at once; but here if you
owe money, you are summoned to show cause why you don't
pay it; which if you don't do, you have six days allowed you
before a caption comes out against your person; which is
executed by these messengers only, who are all put in by the
Lord Lion,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and wear a greyhound on a green ribbon, as
a badge, when they are in the execution of their office.</p>

<p>The ladies dress as in England, with this difference, that
when they go abroad, from the highest to the lowest, they wear
a plaid, which covers half of the face, and all their body. In
Spain, Flanders, and Holland, you know the women go all to
church and market, with a black mantle over their heads and
body: But these in Scotland are all striped with green, scarlet,
and other colours, and most of them lined with silk; which in
the middle of a church, on a Sunday, looks like a <i>parterre de
fleurs</i>.</p>

<p>I have been at several consorts of musick, and must say,
that I never saw in any nation an assembly of greater beauties,
than those I have seen at Edinburgh. The ladies are particular
in a stately firm way of walking, with their joints extended,
and their toes out: But I cannot say, that the common people
are near so clean or handsome as the English. The young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
ladies are all bred good housewives; and the servant-maids are
always kept at some work here: The spinning-wheels, both
for woollen and linnen, are always going in most houses; and
a gentleman of a good estate is not ashamed to wear a suit of
cloaths of his lady's and servants' spinning. They make a great
deal of linnen all over the Kingdom, not only for their own use,
but export it to England, and to the Plantations. In short, the
women are all kept employed, from the highest to the lowest
of them.</p>

<p>But the men here are not so usefully employed as in England:
There the production of every county is improved by joint-stocks
amongst the inhabitants of the several counties. Iron-works,
lead-works, manufactories, and every thing else that
may conduce to the common welfare of the nation, are set on
foot, and carried on. But here, altho their rivers plentifully
abound with salmon for exportation, their coasts with white
fish and herrings, more than any other in Europe; yet the
gentry, or landed men, never concern themselves about it, as
a thing below them; and leave those improvements to burghers
of towns, who, for want of a sufficient stock, are not able to
carry it on.</p>

<p>Indeed, the nobility have of late run into parking, planting,
and gardening, which are great improvements of their estates;
but what is this to the bulk of a nation, which (if encouraged)
hath as many natural commodities for exportation as any
whatsoever, and more than South-Britain? But a finer education
than what is necessary for trade, hath been, in imitation
of the French, the misfortune of this kingdom; but perhaps
the union with England may open their eyes to their own
interest.</p>

<p>The language of the Low-Countries of Scotland is the same
with that which is spoken all over England; only an Englishman
will understand a Scotchman better by his writing than
speaking; for the difference in the pronunciation of the vowels,
which are the same in writing, makes a great alteration in
speaking.</p>

<p>The Scots pronounce the five vowels, a, e, i, o, u, just as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
French, Germans, and Italians do; and the English, according
to that pronunciation, make them &#339;, i, y, o, u. This difference
of sound in the vowels, makes a great one in the pronunciation.</p>

<p>The Highlanders have a language of their own, which the
Irish own to be the purest of that Irish which they spake in
the province of Ulster in Ireland; which is also spoken in the
greatest purity in the Western Islands that lie between Scotland
and Ireland: They being an unmixed people, have preserved
that language and the dress better than the Irish have done,
who have been over-run with Danes, English, etc.</p>

upon the Affairs of Scotland from 1702 to 1715, by George Lockhart,
Esq., of Carnwath. His Secret Correspondence with the Son of
King James the Second from 1718 to 1728, and his other Political
Writings</i>, vol. ii., p. 134. (London: 1817.)</p></div>


<p>About the latter end of the year 1724 a resolution passed the
House of Commons whereby, instead of the malt tax, six pence
per barrel of ale was laid of additional duty on Scotland (and
not extended to England) and the premiums on grain exported
from thence was taken off. As this was a plain breach of the
Union, in so far as it expressly stipulated that there shall be an
equality of taxes and premiums on trade, every Scots man was
highly enraged at it, for as it was evident that the want of the
premiums would effectively stop the exportation of grain, which
would thereby become a mere drug, no body could foresee to
what height this precedent of taxing Scotland separately from
England might afterwards be extended. Tis impossible to
express the resentment of the nation at this measure, all
parties seemed reconciled and to unite in opposing what was
so pernicious to the country in general, and at the same time
touched every particular man's copyhold. The King's friends
laid hold upon this occasion, and privately, underhand, fomented
the bad humour, it not being fit, as indeed there was no need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of their distinguishing their zeal at this time. A meeting of
the heritors of the shire of Edinburgh was called, where I
presented an address to the House of Commons, which being
heartily approved of, was signed and next day sent up by an
express to London....</p>

<p>These warm addresses and instructions did not a little startle
the Scots members of Parliament, and even the Ministry; and
there were likewise many private letters written to them by
their friends, assuring them of the highest resentment if they
did not perform what was desired and expected of them. Had
these members been endued with a public spirit and resolution,
such applications would have been needless; but as they
consisted of a parcel of people of low fortunes that could not
subsist without their board-wages (which at ten guineas a week
during each session was duly paid them) or mere tools and
dependents, it was not to be expected they would act the part
which became them for their country's service, and therefore
these representations were judged necessary to spur them up
to their duty and withal show the Ministry that the people
would not behave so tamely as did their mean spirited
mercenary representatives, who, perceiving they would lose all
their interest and scarce dare venture to return home if they
did not follow the instructions given them, made most humble
applications to the Ministry, who on the other hand being
apprehensive the resentment might be carried to some height,
and unwilling, as matters stood in Europe, to embroil themselves,
thought it expedient to drop the resolutions above
mentioned, (which they at first preferred, because they judged
it would be no easy matter to levy the malt tax in Scotland)
and agreed with the Scots members to impose threepence per
bushel on malt; being but the half of what was laid in
England; and a bill was accordingly passed as fast as the
forms could possibly allow of, least their constituents should
have time to remonstrate against it....</p>

<p>Some little time before the 23rd of June (on which day the
malt tax commenced) delegates were sent from most of the
considerable touns, to meet and confer with the brewers at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Edinburgh, where many proposals were made for eluding the
law, to be, as occasions offered, put in practice: the first thing
to be guarded against was the dutys of malt stock in hand; and
to avoid the heavy penalty of not entering the same, it was
resolved to obey the law in that respect, but at the same time
not to make payment of the duty thereon, and if the Commissioners
of excise sued them, to give over brewing and
consequently sink the revenue of excise, which was indeed
chiefly aimed at by those who bestirred themselves at this time
in behalf of the country, that the Government might perceive
they'd lose more of the excise than they could gain by the malt
tax: but what alarmed people most was the unreasonable
article of surcharge, to be levied proportionately off such as
entered and paid the duty of what was malted after 23rd of
June, in so far as the clear produce (after deducing the charges
of collecting) fell short of 20,000<i>l.</i> sterling, whereby those who
submitted to the Government and paid the malt tax ran the
hazard of making up the deficiencie arising from those who did
otherwise, which so startled all the considerable brewers, who
generally speaking are also maltsters, that they found it
absolutely necessary to malt none after the commencement
of this duty.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of June, when the duty took place, the excise
officers were obliged to fly out of most of the towns in the
western shires, but in Glasgow the resentment ran higher.
Daniell Campbell of Shawfeild, who represented that burgh
in Parliament, having incurred the hatred of the inhabitants
thereof, because he was believed, on too good grounds, to have
had the chief hand in giving the Government such informations
of the way and manner of trading there, as occasioned a few
years ago an act of Parliament, that lay heavily on their
tobacco trade, was likewise said and believed to have
encouraged to hope there was no difficulty in raising the
malt tax; and these joined together rendered him detestable
over all the Kingdom, especially at Glasgow, where they
threatened to pull down his new built house, whereof he sent
notice to Wade at Edinburgh on 21st of June, who thereupon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
ordered a detachment of foot to march forthwith thither, where
they arrived on the 24th at night, but the guard room being
unprepared, they put off taking possession of it till next day,
the soldiers being dismist to their several private quarters.
During the night time a report went about that Daniell
Campbell had brought these soldiers to enslave them, whereupon
the mob got up and destroyed his house, and had he
himself been in town, they had certainly dewitted him. Whilst
this was in hand the commanding officer got his men together,
took possession of the guard room and drew up before it, and
tho he met with no insult but from some boys and women, who
threw a few stones at his men, without having previously read
the proclamation, as directed by the law on such occasions, he
fired allongst the streets, which being full of innocent people
that came out of curiosity to know what the matter was, and
the windows at the same time crowded with spectators, about
20 men and women were killd dead and many more wounded,
some whereof in the streets and others in their houses: the
citizens being thereby enraged did ring the fire bell and brake
up the magazine, from whence they armed about 400 men. In
the mean time the magistrates advised the officer to march off
his party, for they could not be protected within the city; on
which he made the best of his way to Dumbarton, but not
thinking himself safe in that town he retired into the castle.
The Glasgow mob pursued him a few miles but could not
overtake him.</p>

<p class="hd4"><span class="smcap">Letter XXVI. Concerning the New Roads, etc., 173-.</span></p>

<p>These new roads were begun in the year 1726, and have
continued about eleven years in the prosecution; yet, long as
it may be thought, if you were to pass over the whole work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
(for the borders of it would show you what it was), I make no
doubt but that number of years would diminish in your imagination
to a much shorter tract of time, by comparison with the
difficulties that attended the execution.</p>

<p>But, before I proceed to any particular descriptions of
them, I shall inform you how they lie, to the end that you
may trace them out upon a map of Scotland; and first I
shall take them as they are made, to enter the mountains,
viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>One of them begins from Crief, which is about fourteen miles
from Stirling: here the Romans left off their works, of which
some parts are visible to this day, particularly the camp at
Ardoch, where the vestiges of the fortifications are on a moor
so barren, that its whole form has been safe from culture, or
other alteration besides weather and time.</p>

<p>The other road enters the hills at Dimheld,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> in Athol, which
is about ten miles from Perth.</p>

<p>The first of them, according to my account, though the last
in execution, proceeds through Glenalmond (which, for its
narrowness, and the height of the mountains, I remember to
have mentioned formerly), and thence it goes to Aberfaldy;
there it crosses the river Tay by a bridge of free-stone, consisting
of five spacious arches (by the way, this military bridge
is the only passage over that wild and dangerous river), and
from thence the road goes on to Dalnachardoch.</p>

<p>The other road from Dunkeld proceeds by the Blair of Athol
to the said Dalnachardoch.</p>

<p>Here the two roads join in one, and, as a single road, it leads
on to Dalwhinny, where it branches out again into two; of
which one proceeds towards the north-west, through Garva
Moor, and over the Coriarach mountain to Fort Augustus, at
Killichumen, and the other branch goes due-north to the barrack
of Ruthven, in Badenoch, and thence, by Delmagary, to Inverness.
From thence it proceeds something to the southward of
the west, across the island, to the aforesaid Fort-Augustus
and so on to Fort-William, in Lochaber.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The length of all these roads put together is about two
hundred and fifty miles....</p>

<p>In the summer seasons, five hundred of the soldiers from
the barracks, and other quarters about the Highlands, were
employed in those works in different stations, by detachments
from the regiments and Highland companies.</p>

<p>The private men were allowed sixpence a day, over and
above their pay as soldiers: a corporal had eight-pence, and
a sergeant a shilling; but this extra pay was only for working-days,
which were often interrupted by violent storms of wind
and rain, from the heights and hollows of the mountains.</p>

<p>These parties of men were under the command and direction
of proper officers, who were all subalterns, and received two
shillings and sixpence <i>per diem</i>, to defray their extraordinary
expence in building huts; making necessary provision for their
tables from distant parts; unavoidable though unwelcome visits,
and other incidents arising from their wild situation....</p>

<p>The standard breadth of these roads, as laid down at the
first projection, is sixteen feet; but in some parts, where there
were no very expensive difficulties, they are wider....</p>

<p>The old ways (for roads I shall not call them) consisted
chiefly of stony moors, bogs, rugged, rapid fords, declivities of
hills, entangling woods, and giddy precipices. You will say
this is a dreadful catalogue to be read to him that is about to
take a Highland journey. I have not mentioned the valleys,
for they are few in number, far divided asunder, and generally
the roads through them were easily made.</p>

<p>My purpose now is to give you some account of the nature
of the particular parts above-mentioned, and the manner how
this extraordinary work has been executed; and this I shall do
in the order I have ranged them as above.</p>

<p>And first, the stony moors. These are mostly tracts of
ground of several miles in length, and often very high, with
frequent lesser risings and descents, and having for surface
a mixture of stones and heath. The stones are fixed in the
earth, being very large and unequal, and generally are as deep
in the ground as they appear above it; and where there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
any spaces between the stones, there is a loose spongy sward,
perhaps not above five or six inches deep, and incapable to
produce any thing but heath, and all beneath it is hard gravel
or rock....</p>

<p>Here the workmen first made room to fix their instruments,
and then, by strength, and the help of those two mechanic
powers, the screw and the lever, they raised out of their
ancient beds those massive bodies, and then filling up the
cavities with gravel, set them up, mostly end-ways, along the
sides of the road, as directions in time of deep snows, being
some of them, as they now stand, eight or nine feet high.
They serve, likewise, as memorials of the skill and labour
requisite to the performance of so difficult a work....</p>

<p>Now that I have no further occasion for any distinction,
I shall call every soft place a bog, except there be occasion
sometimes to vary the phrase.</p>

<p>When one of these bogs has crossed the way on a stony
moor, there the loose ground has been dug out down to the
gravel, or rock, and the hollow filled up in the manner following,
viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>First with a layer of large stones, then a smaller size, to
fill up the gaps and raise the causeway higher; and, lastly,
two, three, or more feet of gravel, to fill up the interstices of
the small stones, and form a smooth and binding surface.
This part of the road has a bank on each side, to separate it
from a ditch, which is made without-side to receive the water
from the bog, and, if the ground will allow it, to convey it by
a trench to a slope, and thereby in some measure drain it....</p>

<p>The objections made to these new roads and bridges, by
some in the several degrees of <i>condition</i> among the Highlanders,
are in part as follow: viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>I. These chiefs and other gentlemen complain, that thereby
an easy passage is opened into their country for strangers,
who, in time, by their suggestions of liberty, will weaken that
attachment of their vassals which it is so necessary for them
to support and preserve. That their fastnesses being laid
open, they are deprived of that security from invasion which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they formerly enjoyed. That the bridges, in particular, will
render the ordinary people effeminate, and less fit to pass the
waters in other places where there are none. And there is
a pecuniary reason concealed, relating to some foreign courts,
which to you I need not explain.</p>

<p>II. The middling order say to them the roads are an inconvenience,
instead of being useful, as they have turned them
out of their old ways; for their horses being never shod, the
gravel would soon whet away their hoofs, so as to render them
unserviceable; whereas the rocks and moor-stones, though
together they make a rough way, yet, considered separately,
they are generally pretty smooth on the surface where they

beginning in drawing the people towards a better taste in
Garden stuff, which tho' you had made no other profit directly,
yet that, if you had saved yourself only, as to the expence,
would have been getting [profit], as it would have encreased
the demand next year.... Your father's Garden is well
sheltered by the houses and rising Ground from the one hand
and by the high hedge of the other, and he has water at hand.
So he may raise any thing in it the climate will allow of. He
has crowded it with fruit trees, too thick even for them to bear
as they would, espicially when a little older, as in that warm
place they advance very fast. By this he loses the undergrowth
also, by which he might make double what he makes
by the fruit from the trees, espicially they being of the most
common fruit, which would answer as well in the most exposed
part of his field. So warm a lying spot should either have
been employed entirely in doubled crops for a Kitchen, or, if
for fruit, it should have been in kinds every spot won't
produce, and for that reason yielded more. I incline to think
mulberys would have done of either side the walk at the lower
end, as being warm and covered from all severe weather. If
so, one tree of them would have yielded as much money as
half a dozen of the common apples now in it, and would have
taken no more room than one of the present. I am convinced
that if Mulberys will do any where in Scotld. they will there,
it being entirely covered from Weather and yet open to the
Sun, except in so far as shaded by apple trees.... What I
aim at is to turn your ground to the best and most proper
uses, the warmest and best to what requires it, and the
common coarse fruits or herbs to places where they will do
and the nicer won't....</p>

<p>Depend upon it there are people in Eden.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> who have taste,
and if you can once get into the custom of some who have it,
will put others upon enquiring where they had good things,
and this will hold in your herbs etc. as well as in your Fruit.
Do you think it possible that there are not Families and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Taverns in Eden. that would give reasonably for young pease
and Beans in July and Aug<sup>t</sup> if they could get them. Suppose
now you sent a dish of young pease or Beans to any of your
Customers when only old are to be had, and desire them to let
their acquaintances know you can furnish the like, don't you
think they would go off, or if you got into the custom of such
as Mrs. Thom, who keeps a Tavern, do you believe she would
not find people who would be glad of them, and so would take
from you. Possibly they may not give such a price as just
when first coming in, but if you get a price you can afford
them at, it does your business.... People would presently
come to distinguish as they came in to buy when Garden stuff
was first introduced. But our people are lazie, and saying no
body will buy and no body will distinguish, is chiefly owing to
the want of activity, Industry and care in providing at all or
good of their kinds, and bustling a little to introduce and get
Customers at first. We are glad of all excuses for our sleeping
on in poverty and our old jog trott. How shall things be

very good difficulties and convenient enough excuses, wherein

Orm:<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> but I am convinced one who understood his business,

Gardiners who come to Covent Garden use. They would
carry things cool and clean, and one man with two horses in
such a Cart, would carry in as much as four Carriers with 4
horses carry in our common way and if you put your things up
in Baskets carefully as Gardiners do here, by which they'l not
be wet, Bruised or Broiled in the Sun, the Cart being covered
as the Garden Stuff commonly is, in carrying to Eden. Even
care in this will make them fresher and better than what is
now to be had there.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<i>Autobiography of the Rev. Dr. Alexander Carlyle, Minister of
Inveresk, 1722-1770</i>, p. 33. (Edinburgh and London: 1860.)</p></div>


<p>I was witness to a very extraordinary scene that happened
in the month of February or March 1736, which was the
escape of Robertson, a condemned criminal, from the Tolbooth
Church in Edinburgh. In these days it was usual to bring
the criminals who were condemned to death into that church,
to attend public worship every Sunday after their condemnation,
when the clergyman made some part of his discourse and
prayers to suit their situation; which, among other circumstances
of solemnity which then attended the state of condemned
criminals, had no small effect on the public mind. Robertson
and Wilson were smugglers, and had been condemned for
robbing a custom-house, where some of their goods had been
deposited; a crime what at that time did not seem, in the
opinion of the common people, to deserve so severe a punishment.
I was carried by an acquaintance to church to see
the prisoners on the Sunday before the day of execution.
We went early into the church on purpose to see them come
in, and were seated in a pew before the gallery in front of
the pulpit. Soon after we went into the church by the door
from the Parliament Close, the criminals were brought in
by the door next the Tolbooth, and placed in a long pew, not
far from the pulpit. Four soldiers came in with them, and
placed Robertson at the head of the pew, and Wilson below
him, two of themselves sitting below Wilson, and two in a pew
behind him.</p>

<p>The bells were ringing and the doors were open, while the
people were coming into the church. Robertson watched his
opportunity, and, suddenly springing up, got over the pew into
the passage that led in to the door in the Parliament Close,
and, no person offering to lay hands on him, made his escape
in a moment&mdash;so much the more easily, perhaps, as everybody's
attention was drawn to Wilson, who was a stronger man, and
who, attempting to follow Robertson, was seized by the soldiers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and struggled so long with them that the two who at last followed
Robertson were too late. It was reported that he had maintained
his struggle that he might let his companion have time. That
might be his second thought, but his first certainly was to
escape himself, for I saw him set his foot on the seat to leap
over, when the soldiers pulled him back. Wilson was immediately
carried out to the Tolbooth, and Robertson, getting
uninterrupted through the Parliament Square, down the back
stairs, into the Cowgate, was heard of no more till he arrived
in Holland. This was an interesting scene, and by filling the
public mind with compassion for the unhappy person who did
not escape, and who was the better character of the two, had
probably some influence in producing what followed; for when
the sentence against Wilson came to be executed a few weeks
thereafter, a very strong opinion prevailed that there was a plot
to force the Town Guard, whose duty it is to attend executions
under the order of a civil magistrate.</p>

<p>There was a Captain Porteous, who by his good behaviour
in the army had obtained a subaltern's commission, and had
afterwards, when on half-pay, been preferred to the command
of the City Guard. This man, by his skill in manly exercises,
particularly the golf, and by gentlemanly behaviour, was
admitted into the company of his superiors, which elated his
mind, and added insolence to his native roughness, so that he
was much feared and hated by the mob of Edinburgh. When
the day of execution came, the rumour of a deforcement at the
gallows prevailed strongly; and the Provost and Magistrates
(not in their own minds very strong) thought it a good measure
to apply for three or four companies of a marching regiment
that lay in the Canongate, to be drawn up in the Lawnmarket,
a street leading from the Tolbooth to the Grassmarket, the
place of execution, in order to overawe the mob by their being
at hand. Porteous, who it is said, had his natural courage
increased to rage by any suspicion that he and his Guard could
not execute the law, and being heated likewise with wine&mdash;for
he had dined, as the custom then was, between one and
two&mdash;became perfectly furious when he passed by the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
companies drawn up in the street as he marched along with
his prisoner.</p>

<p>... The street is long and wide, and there was a very great
crowd assembled. The execution went on with the usual
forms, and Wilson behaved in a manner very becoming his
situation. There was not the least appearance of an attempt
to rescue; but soon after the executioner had done his duty,
there was an attack made upon him, as usual on such occasions,
by the boys and blackguards throwing stones and dirt
in testimony of their abhorrence of the hangman. But there
was no attempt to break through the guard and cut down the
prisoner. It was generally said that there was very little, if any,
more violence than had usually happened on such occasions.
Porteous, however, inflamed with wine and jealousy, thought
proper to order his Guard to fire, their muskets being loaded
with slugs; and when the soldiers showed reluctance, I saw
him turn to them with threatening gesture and an inflamed
countenance. They obeyed, and fired; but wishing to do as
little harm as possible, many of them elevated their pieces,
the effect of which was that some people were wounded in the
windows; and one unfortunate lad, whom we had displaced,
was killed in the stair window by a slug entering his head.
His name was Henry Black, a journey man tailor, whose
bride was the daughter of the house we were in. She fainted
away when he was brought into the house speechless, where
he only lived till nine or ten o'clock. We had seen many
people, women and men, fall in the street, and at first thought
it was only through fear, and by their crowding on one another
to escape. But when the crowd dispersed, we saw them lying
dead or wounded, and had no longer any doubt of what had
happened. The numbers were said to be eight or nine killed,
and double the number wounded; but this was never exactly
known.</p>

<p>This unprovoked slaughter irritated the common people to
the last; and the state of grief and rage into which their minds
were thrown, was visible in the high commotion that appeared
in the multitude.... The sequel of this affair was, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Porteous was tried and condemned to be hanged; but by the
intercession of some of the Judges themselves, who thought
his case hard, he was reprieved by the Queen-Regent. The
Magistrates, who on this occasion, as on the former, acted
weakly, designed to have him removed to the Castle for greater
security. But a plot was laid and conducted by some persons
unknown with the greatest secrecy, policy, and vigour, to prevent
that design, by forcing the prison the night before, and executing
the sentence upon him themselves, which to effectuate cost
them from eight at night till two in the morning; and yet this
plot was managed so dexterously that they met with no interruption,
though there were five companies of a marching
regiment lying in the Canongate.</p>

<p>This happened on the 7th of September, 1736; and so
prepossessed were the minds of every person that something
extraordinary would take place that day, that I, at Prestonpans,
nine miles from Edinburgh, dreamt that I saw Captain
Porteous hanged in the Grassmarket. I got up betwixt six
and seven, and went to my father's servant, who was thrashing
in the barn which lay on the roadside leading to Aberlady and
North Berwick, who said that several men on horseback had
passed about five in the morning, whom having asked for
news, they replied there was none, but that Captain Porteous
had been dragged out of prison, and hanged on a dyer's tree at
two o'clock that morning.</p>

<p>This bold and lawless deed not only provoked the Queen,
who was Regent at the time, but gave some uneasiness to
Government. It was represented as a dangerous plot, and
was ignorantly connected with a great meeting of zealous
Covenanters, of whom many still remained in Galloway and
the west, which had been held in summer, in Pentland Hills, to
renew the Covenant. But this was a mistake; for the murder
of Porteous had been planned and executed by a few of the
relations or friends of those whom he had slain; who, being of
a rank superior to mere mob, had carried on their design with
so much secrecy, ability, and steadiness as made it be ascribed to
a still higher order, who were political enemies to Government.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Source.</b>&mdash;<i>The Statistical Account of Scotland, drawn up from the
communications of the ministers of the different parishes</i>, vol. v.,
p. 266, by Sir John Sinclair, Bart. (Edinburgh: 1793.)</p></div>


<p class="hd5"><i>Statistical Account of Cambuslang.</i></p>

<p>In the statistical account of this parish, it will doubtless be
expected, that some mention should be made of those remarkable
religious phenomena, which took place under Mr. M'Culloch's
ministry, commonly called "Cambuslang conversions."
In treating of this subject, it will be proper to give a brief
historical view, first of the facts, and then of the opinions
entertained concerning them.</p>

<p>The kirk of Cambuslang being small and in bad repair, the
minister, when the weather was favourable, used to preach in
a tent, erected close by a rivulet, at the foot of a bank or brae
near the kirk; which is still called "the preaching or conversion
brae."... Towards the end of January, 1742, two persons,
Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver,
went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to
subscribe a petition, which was presented to the minister,
desiring that he would give them a weekly lecture.... On
Monday, 15th February, and the two following days, all the
fellowship meetings in the parish convened in one body in the
minister's house, and were employed for many hours in fervent
prayer for the success of the gospel, and for an outpouring of
the Holy Spirit in their bounds, as in other places abroad: The
next day, being Thursday 18th February, nothing remarkable
happened during the lecture, except that the hearers were
apparently all attention; but when the minister in his last
prayer expressed himself thus: "Lord who hath believed our
report; and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? where
are the fruits of my poor labours among this people?" several
persons in the congregation cried out publicly, and about 50
men and women came to the minister's house, expressing strong
conviction of sin, and alarming fears of punishment. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
this period, so many people from the neighbourhood resorted
to Cambuslang, that the minister thought himself obliged to
provide them with daily sermons or exhortations, and actually
did so for 7 or 8 months.</p>

<p>The way in which the converts were affected, for it seems
they were all affected much in the same way, though in very
different degrees, is thus described. They were seized all at
once, commonly by something said in the sermons or prayers,
with the most dreadful apprehensions concerning the state of
their souls, insomuch that many of them could not abstain from
crying out in the most public and dreadful manner, ... The
agony under which they laboured, was expressed not only by
words, but also by violent agitations of body; by clapping their
hands and beating their breasts; by shaking and trembling; by
faintings and convulsions; and sometimes by excessive bleeding
at the nose. While they were in this distress, the minister
often called out to them, not to stifle or smother their convictions,
but to encourage them; and, after sermon was ended,
he retired with them to the manse, and frequently spent the
best part of the night with them in exhortations and prayers.
Next day before sermon began, they were brought out,
commonly by More and Bowman, and having napkins tied
round their heads, were placed all together on seats before the
tent, where they remained sobbing, weeping, and often crying
aloud, till the service was over. Some of those who fell under
conviction were never converted; but most of those who fell
under it were converted in a few days, and sometimes in a few
hours.... From the time of their conviction to their conversion,
many had no appetite for food, or inclination to sleep,
and all complained of the severity of their sufferings during
that interval.</p>

<p>This singular work soon became public, made a great noise,
and brought vast numbers of people from all quarters....
Among those who resorted to Cambuslang on this occasion,
there were many of the most popular ministers in Scotland;
... M<sup>r</sup> Whitefield,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> who had been in England for several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
months, did not arrive till June. The sacrament was given
twice in the space of 5 weeks, viz. on 11th July and 15th August.
Immense multitudes of hearers and spectators were present at
both, but especially at the last. On the Sunday, besides the
tent at the foot of the brae above described, where the sacrament
was dispensed, other two tents were erected. At each of
these there was a very great congregation. M<sup>r</sup> Whitefield,
who was accustomed to numerous audiences, supposed, that at
the three tents, there were upwards of 30,000 people; a greater
number probably than was ever seen on any other sacramental
occasion. Most of the above mentioned ministers and others
were assistants at this solemnity. Four preached on the fast-day,
4 on Saturday, probably 14 or 15 on Sunday, and 5 on
Monday. There were 25 tables, about 120 at each, in all
3,000 communicants. A great many of these came from
Glasgow and the neighbourhood, about 200 from Edinburgh,
about 200 from Kilmarnock, about 200 from Irvine and
Stewarton, and some from England and Ireland.... The
Cambuslang work continued for about six months, that is, from
the 18th February till the second communion.</p>

<p>In a state of profound tranquillity, we have been
alarmed with advices, which are said to have been received at
London, of intended invasions; and particularly of a visit
which the Pretender's eldest son is about to make to us, if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
has not already made it. These informations, particularly as
to the visit just mentioned, I must confess, have not hitherto
gain'd my belief. This young gentleman's game seems at
present to be very desperate in this country; and, so far as I
can learn, there is not the least apparatus for his reception,
even amongst the few highlanders who are suspected to be in
his interest. However, as, when so much is at stake, no
advice, how improbable soever, is to be neglected, I have (our
session being now over) resolved to make my accustomed
journey northwards a little earlier than usual; to the end that,
though my fighting days are over, I may give some countenance
to the friends of the government, and prevent the
seduction of the unwary, if there should be any truth in what
is reported.</p>


<p class="hd5"><i>Mr. Normand MacLeod to the Lord President.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Lord,</span></p>

<p>To my no small surprise, it is certain that the Pretended
Prince of Wales is come on the coast of South Uist and
Barra, and has since been hovering on parts of the coast of the
main land that lies between the point of Airdnamurchan and
Glenelg; he has but one ship, of which he is aboard; she
mounts about 16 or 18 guns. He has about thirty Irish or
French officers with him, and one Sheridan, who is called his
Governor. The Duke of Athol's brother is the only man of
any sort of note (that once belonged to this country) that I can
hear of that's alongst with him. His view, I need not tell you,
was, to raise all the Highlands to assist him, etc. Sir Alex.
Macdonald and I, not only gave no sort of countenance to
these people, but we used all the interest we had with our
neighbours to follow the same prudent method; and I am
persuaded we have done it with that success, that not one man
of any consequence benorth the Grampians will give any sort
of assistance to this mad rebellious attempt. How far you
think we acted properly, I shall long to know; but this is
certain, we did it as our duty and for the best; for in the
present situation of affairs in Europe, I should have been sorry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to see any thing like disaffection to the Government appear,

there is not....</p>

<p>The Chevalier was now preparing to come to the rendezvous

the 17th in the evening with only three companys of Clanronalds

a short but very pathetick speech. Importing that it would be
no purpose to declaim upon the justice of his father's title to
the throne to people who, had they not been convinced of it,
would not have appeared in his behalf, but that he esteemed it
as much his duty to endeavour to procure their welfare and
happiness as they did to assert his right, that it was chiefly
with that view that he had landed in a part of the Island where
he knew he should find a number of brave gentlemen fired
with the "noble example of their predecessors, and jealous of
their own and their country's honour, to join with him in so
glorious an enterprise, with whose assistance and the protection
of a just God who never fails to avenge the cause of the
injured, he did not doubt of bringing the affair to a happy

upon the 21st he moved from the place of rendezvous to the
head of Locheil, about nine miles from Fort William, and as
the difficulty of finding horses and the badness of the roads in
this country were equally unsurmountable, of twenty large
swevel guns he made twelve be buried in a bog about a mile
from the place where he first erected his standard. He had no
sooner arrived at the above mentioned place than he received
intelligence of G[eneral] C[ope] having moved north ward and
at the same time had a copy of the proclamation sent which
had been ishued by order of the Lords Justices, affixing thirty
thousand pound upon his head....</p>

<p>Upon seeing it he was heard to say that tho it was true that
a reward had been likewise set upon his father's head in the
year 1715, that yet he imagined that in proportion as the world
grew in politeness they had done so in humanity, that it were
unjust to call the ancients rude and savage etc., when no
example could be given of their taking so mean and unmanly
a way to get rid of their enemy. That he should have been
far from ever thinking of such a device to exterminate the
E[lector]s family did his success depend upon it, but at the
same time he could not in justice to him self get<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> by offering
the same reward in his turn. Tho if he could allow himself
to think that any of his friends could be so abandoned as to be
guilty of so execrable a deed for the sum proposed, that he
would alter the sum to thirty pound instead of thirty thousand,
and then ordered a proclamation of the same nature to be
drawn, which was signed and published two days after.</p>

<p>The night between the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> of September passed
without disturbance. Six or seven hundred men, consisting
of the Trained Bands, the Edinburgh volunteers, and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
volunteers who came in from the towns of Musselburgh and
Dalkeith, were upon guard at the different gates of the city.
On Monday the 16<sup>th</sup> the rebels advanced slowly towards
Edinburgh, giving time for the terror of their approach to
operate upon the minds of unwarlike citizens, in a divided city.
Between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, a message was
delivered from the young Pretender to the people of Edinburgh,
acquainting them that if they would admit him peaceably into
the city, they should be civilly dealt with, if not they must lay
their account with military execution.</p>

<p>Instantly the clamour rose, and crowds of people ran about
the streets crying out, that it was madness to think of resistance,
since the dragoons were fled; and some of them meeting
Provost Stuart, as he returned from the West Port (where he
had gone to give orders after the retreat of the dragoons),
followed him to the Parliament Square, beseeching him not to
persist in defending the town, for if he did they should all be
murdered. The Provost reprimanded them; and went to the
Goldsmiths' Hall, where the Magistrates and Town Council
were assembled, with a good many of the inhabitants. A
deputation was sent to the Justice Clerk, the Advocate, and the
Solicitor, to entreat that they would come and assist the Council
with their advice. The deputies returned, and reported that all
these gentlemen had left the town. Provost Stuart then sent
for the captains of the volunteers, and the Trained Bands, and
desired to have their opinion concerning the defence of the
town. The officers said very little, and seemed to be at a loss
what opinion to give; other people in the meeting made
speeches for and against the defence of the town, not without
reproach and abuse on both sides. The crowd encreased to
such a degree, that it became necessary to adjourn to a
larger place, and the meeting adjourned to the New Church
Aisle, which was immediately filled with people, the most
part of whom called to give up the town; that it was
impossible to defend it. Those who attempted to speak
against the general opinion, were borne down with noise and
clamour....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>About ten o'clock at night the deputies<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> returned, and
brought a letter in answer to the message sent by them.</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness the Prince Regent thinks his
Manifesto, and the King his father's declaration already
published, a sufficient capitulation for all His Majesty's
subjects to accept of with joy. His present demands are to be
received into the city, as the son and representative of the King
his father, and obeyed as such when there, His Royal Highness
supposes, that since the receipt of his letter to the Provost, no
arms or ammunition have been suffered to be carried off or
concealed, and will expect a particular account of all things of
that nature. Lastly, he expects a positive answer, before two
o'clock in the morning, otherwise he will think himself obliged
to take measures conform.</p>

<p>"At Gray's Mill, 16<sup>th</sup> September, 1745. By his Highness's
command.</p>

<p class="author">"(Signed) J. Murray."</p>

<p>When this letter was read, Provost Stuart said, there was
one condition in it, which he would die rather than submit to,
which was receiving the son of the Pretender as Prince Regent;
for he was bound by oath to another master. After long
deliberation it was determined to send out deputies once more,
to beg a suspension of hostilities till nine o'clock in the
morning, that the Magistrates might have an opportunity of
conversing with the citizens, most of whom were gone to
bed. The deputies were also instructed to receive an explanation
of what was meant by receiving Charles as Prince
Regent.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the morning the deputies set out in a
hackney coach for Gray's Mill; when they arrived there they
prevailed upon Lord George Murray to second their application
for a delay; but Charles refused to grant it; and the deputies
were ordered in his name to get them gone.</p>

<p>The coach brought them back to Edinburgh, set them down
in the High-Street, and then drove towards the Canongate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
When the Nether Bow port was opened to let out the coach,
800 Highlanders, led by Cameron of Locheil, rushed in and
took possession of the city.</p>

<p>It was about five o'clock in the morning when the rebels
entered Edinburgh. They immediately sent parties to all the
other gates, and to the town guard, who making the soldiers
upon duty prisoners, occupied their posts as quietly as one
guard relieves another. When the inhabitants of Edinburgh
awakened in the morning, they found that the Highlanders
were masters of the city.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> the main body of the rebels marching by
Duddingston (to avoid being fired upon by the Castle) entered
the King's Park, and halted in the hollow between the hills,
under the peak called Arthur's seat. By and by Charles came
down to the Duke's Walk, accompanied by the Highland
Chiefs, and other commanders of his army.</p>

<p>The Park was full of people (amongst whom was the author
of this history,) all of them impatient to see this extraordinary
person. The figure and presence of Charles Stuart were not
ill suited to his lofty pretensions. He was in the prime of
youth, tall and handsome, of a fair complexion; he had a light
coloured periwig with his own hair combed over the front: he
wore the Highland dress, that is a tartan short coat without
the plaid, a blue bonnet on his head, and on his breast the star
of the order of St. Andrew. Charles stood some time in the
park to show himself to the people; and then, though he was
very near the palace, mounted his horse, either to render
himself more conspicuous, or because he rode well, and looked
graceful on horseback.</p>

<p>The Jacobites were charmed with his appearance: they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
compared him to Robert the Bruce, whom he resembled (they
said) in his figure as in his fortune. The Whigs looked upon
him with other eyes. They acknowledged that he was a
goodly person; but they observed, that even in that triumphant
hour, when he was about to enter the palace of his fathers, the
air of his countenance was languid and melancholy: that he
looked like a gentleman and man of fashion, but not like a
hero or conqueror. Hence they formed their conclusions that
the enterprize was above the pitch of his mind; and that his
heart was not great enough for the sphere in which he moved.
When Charles came to the palace, he dismounted, and walked
along the piazza, towards the apartment of the Duke of
Hamilton. When he was near the door, which stood open to
receive him, a gentleman stepped out of the crowd, drew his
sword, and raising his arm aloft, walked up stairs before
Charles. The person who enlisted himself in this manner, was
James Hepburn of Keith, whose name will be mentioned again
more than once....</p>

<p>The Highlanders, when they entered the town in the
morning, had secured the Heralds and Pursuivants: at midday
they surrounded the Cross with a body of armed men, and
obliged the Heralds to proclaim King James, to read the
Commission of Regency, and the Declaration, dated at Rome,
in December 1743, with a Manifesto in the name of Charles
Prince Regent, dated at Paris, 16th of May, 1745. An immense
multitude witnessed this ceremony, which was performed
at noon. The populace of a great city, who huzza for
any thing that brings them together, huzzaed; and a number
of ladies in the windows strained their voices with acclamation,
and their arms with waving white handkerchiefs in honour of
the day. These demonstrations of joy, amongst people of
condition, were chiefly confined to one sex; few gentlemen
were to be seen on the streets, or in the windows; and even
amongst the inferior people, many shewed their dislike by a
stubborn silence.</p>

<p>On thursday the 19th, in the evening, the Chevalier had
certain intelligence that G<sup>ll</sup> Cope had marched that morning
from Dunbar, and was to encamp that night at Haddingtown,
upon which he immediately gave orders for the guards of the
City to retire early next morning, and he went himself that
night to Duddingston....</p>

<p>In obedience to the orders given on the morning of the
twentieth the guards retired from the City and joined the army
at Duddingston, and brought alongst with them some surgeons,
with whom the army was then very ill provided, and some
coaches and chaises were likewise ordered for the conveniency
of the wounded, so certain was the prospect of a battle, and
even a successful one. Thus all things being prepared about
nine in the morning, after receiving an exact account of the
number of the enemy taken at Haddington, the Chevalier put
himself at the head of his small army, drawing his sword, said
with a very determined countenance, Gentlemen, I have flung
away the scabbard, with God's assistance I don't doubt of
making you a free and happy people, Mr. Cope shall not escape
us as he did in the Highlands, and then began his march,
ordering the few horse, he then had, not above fifty in number,
to advance at some small distance in front, and to detach a few
to discover the enemy's march. In this manner, with the
Camerons in front, he marched in good order, crossing Musselburgh
bridge by Pinky park wall. By this time the party of
horse sent intelligence that G<sup>ll</sup> Cope was nigh to Tranent, from
which the Chevalier conjectured that he would engage him on
the muir to the west ward of that village, and therefore
quickened his march to prevent his gaining the brow of
Carberry hill before him, but before he had near reached the
top of the hill he was told that Sir John had marched to the
left, and posted himself in a low ground betwixt Preston and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Seaton. This naturally led him to imagine that he intended to
avoid coming to action; and made him determine, if possible,
to attack him the same day. With this view he advanced to
the hill and drew up his army opposite to G<sup>ll</sup> Cope, who was
formed in the low ground before mentioned in two lines, with
the two regiments of Dragoons on his wings. So soon as the
Chevalier had taken a view of the enemy he judged it impossible
to attack them in the post they was then in, having a
deep ditch in their front which runs along the high road,
where he must have sustained great loss before he could pass
it; but being determined that at no rate the enemy should give
him the slip a second time, he ordered a detachment to take
possession of the Church yard which commanded their camp
on the left, and as that seemed the only side where it was
possible to come at them, he enquired if there was none in the
army acquainted with the country to know if the ground would
allow him to attack them on the left. There happened to be a
gentleman in the army of that county, who told him that there
was only one pass on the left whereby not guarded he could
come to them, upon which he ordered it to be reconnoitred, and
finding it neglected he ordered a detachment of 500 men to be
posted upon the high road to the west of Preston to prevent
the enemys retiring by that road to Edinburgh, and recalling
the detachment from the Church yard he marched his army
eastward by the town of Tranent, and drew up in one line
opposite to the flank of the enemy, who upon that motion made
a half wheel to face him, expecting, as it was imagined, that
he then designed to attack them, and which L. G. M&mdash;y<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
proposed, as the Highlanders were then full of spirits, and
above all things desirous to engage; but the night being then
far advanced, the Chevalier thought it better to delay coming
to an engagement till next morning, not knowing what might
be the consequence of a rencounter in the night should the
enemy, if beat, rally and come upon him while in confusion
and not able to get his people together, knowing how difficult
it was to keep irregular troops together in a body after an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
action, so resolved to delay it till early next morning, and
ordered his army to halt upon the ground about three or four
hundred yards from the enemy, and to continue under arms to
be ready to march upon a minutes warning.</p>

<p>They accordingly lay close in order of battle the whole night
without the least whisper or noise to be heard, while G<sup>ll</sup> Cope
made some fires in his camp and threw a few shells, which did
no hurt. Having continued in this position for some time, he
was informed that the detachment of five hundred Atholl men
which he had posted upon the west side of the village of Preston
had rejoined the army; this made him very uneasy least the
enemy had filed off during the night by that road and had
taken possession of the City of Edin<sup>r</sup>, to prevent which and
to intercept the runaways had enduced him to make that disposition.
He at first seemed resolved to make them return,
but when he reflected that their march, if discovered by the
enemy, might induce them to believe it was the whole army,
and occasion them to alter their disposition or occasion any
confusion or distrust amongst his own people, he judged it
safer and better to put up with the disappointment and continue
the rest of his plan, tho he could not help complaining that his
orders had been neglected in so material a point.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this <i>faux pas</i>, he kept in very high spirits
the rest of the night, laying on the ground without any covering
but his plaid, and in the morning, about an hour before daylight,
made his army, guided by the gentleman above mentioned,
march from the left in three columns, making the left of the
first line the right of the army for the attack, which motion,
tho perhaps irregular, was yet necessary, and executed with so
much order and silence that the small body of horse posted
in the rear knew nothing of their march; the officer on duty,
either through forgetfulness or that he thought they could be
of no service, neglected to give them orders to march. In this
order he marched to the enemy, passing a deep bog with out
the least observation. The right, composed of the M<sup>c</sup>don<sup>ds</sup> of
Glengarry and Clanronald, was commanded by the D. of P.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
and the left, commanded by L.G.M.,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> which had made the
right the preceding day, consisted of the Camerons and Steuarts
of Appin. The third column, which was made up of the Atholl
men, was commanded by My L[ord] N[airn]. So soon as the
two first columns had passed the bog, they formed and marched
straight to the enemy, who by this time had formed and presented
themselves in the same order of battle they had appeared
the day before. By this time the third column had likewise
passed and formed themselves about four score yards in the
rear of the first line; rather too near, if the ground would have
allowed of a more regular disposition. The left, when pretty
near the enemy, finding themselves outwinged, made a motion
to front the artillery, which occasioned a gap in the centre, but
marching up briskly, they received one fire of the cannon, which
did little hurt, and then receiving a fire from the foot, they gave
a loud huzza, returning the fire, upon which Gairdner's dragoons
run off, and the Highlanders, throwing away their muskets,
attacked the foot with incredible impetuosity, who immediately
gave ground. Upon the left of the enemy the resistance, if
such behaviour merits the name, was much less, for before the
D. of P. was within three score yards of them, Hamilton's
dragoons began to reel and run off before they could receive
his fire; the foot likewise fired too soon, and almost all turned
their backs before the Highlanders could engage them with
their swords. In a few minutes the rout was total; the
dragoons on the right run off by the high road through the
town of Preston, and those on the left by the shore towards
the east; the few of the foot that saved themselves escaped
by Preston Park, the wall of which had been broke down the
day before by G<sup>ll</sup> Cope's orders. All the baggage of the army
was placed in a yard upon the left of their army, guarded
by two companies of L. Lowdon's regiment, where so soon
as the action was over, Cap<sup>t</sup> Bazil Cochran of Coll. Lees<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
was sent by L.G.M. to tell them that if they would
immediately surrender as prisoners of war they should be used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as such, if not, they would be immediately attacked and
no quarter given, upon which they readily gave up their
arms.</p>

<p>About the beginning of Nov<sup>r</sup> the Prince called a council
o' war, wherein H.R.H. determined to march into England
with the forces he then had, and not to wait those who were
coming up, but ordered them to follow.</p>

<p>We marched on without halt till we came to Brampton,
near Carlile, where the Prince rested with part o' the army,
and order'd the siege of Carlile, which surrender'd after four
days' siege. The next day after the surrender, the Prince
enter'd the town with his whole army, where H.R.H. remain'd
some days. From thence he march'd straight with his whole
army till he arrived at Darby, where he rested two days; and
H.R.H. called a council o' war, and finding most of the private
people of the army's opinion to be rather to retreat than goe
forward (tho' at the same time H.R.H.'s opinion and inclination
was to goe forward), he agreed to a retreat. Consequently,
we began our retreat next day.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Lord George Murray, who
always had the rear, chose our regiment for the rearguard,
tho' it was not our turn. When we came to Kendal, we had
accounts of the enemy's being close in our rear; and our regiment's
having the rearguard, and likewise the charge of the
artillery. The Prince marched on with the army till they
arrived at Penrith, and the weather very terrible, the rear
could not reach Chap<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> that night, which is halfway twixt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Penrith and Kendal. Lord George took up our quarters in
a little villiage, where we rested that night on our arms, without
thro'ing a stitch of cloaths,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> as we were sure the enemy
was very near us. Next day we marched by daylight, and
for want of proper horses the artillery was very fashious,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and
a last load with cannon shot happening to break on the road,
upon Lord George's giving a hearty dram to the men, they
carried, some one, some two, some three of the shot, with all
their arms and acuterments. All this day some of the enemy's
horse were in our rear, but made no attack. This night we
came to Chap, and after placing our guards and sentinelles,
Lord George, the other gentlemen, and I, took up our quarters
about 8 o'clock at night.... By the break o' day Lord
George order'd to beat to arms, and order'd the artillery on
before. We marched on, expecting every minut the enemy
wou'd be up with us, having none with us but your regiment
and about one hundred and twenty of Roy Stuart's regiment.
About halfway to Penrith, we saw at some distance, to the
number of about 5 or 600 horse, whom we took to be part of
our own army; but upon coming near us they made a form to
attack us. These were militia sent to intercept our march;
but by a detachment we sent to attack them giving them
a smart fire, which kill'd two or three of them, they were
routed, and fled, so we march'd on untill we came to Clifton,
within two short miles of Penrith, where the Prince and his
army lay. Here Lord George got account that some of the
enemy were come to the house of Lowtherhall, about a mile's
distance on our left. He desired me to ask the men (as he
knew they were fatigued) if they were willing to attack that
house. They answer'd me that they were most willing. Upon
which we marched and surrounded the house, and only found
in it one officer, with a footman of the Duke of Cumberland's,
whom he had sent before to take up quarters for him. Upon
our return to Clifton, we perceived the enemy to the number
of about 3000 horse, advanced by this time within &frac14; of a mile
of Clifton. Cluny and his M<sup>c</sup>Phersons, to about the number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of three hundred men, happened to be at this village. Lord
George ordered them on one post on the side of the road, and
our regiment on another on the other side. It was then about
nightset, when the enemy, being all horse, dismounted&mdash;I can't
condescend on their number, being then dark&mdash;and attack'd the
M<sup>c</sup>Phersons, who received them, and after a close fire for some
time on both sides, the enemy were repulsed. Upon this they
sent a stronger body to attack us both, which came directly up
to us, and it being then quite dark, they coming very close to
us, we only heard the noise of their boots, and could plainly
discern their yellow belts. We first received their full fire,
which did us little damage. We immediately gave them ours,
and then attacked them sword in hand, and oblidged them to
retreat with a considerable loss.</p>

<p>Lord George then marched with us and the M<sup>c</sup>Phersons
into the town, where we found the whole army ready to march
for Carlisle, so that we had neither time to refresh ourselves, or
men. So you may judge our condition, having marched t[w]o
days without resting from Kendal to Penrith, which is long
20 miles, and, without halt, 16 more on to Carlisle, all without
any sleep and very little provision; yet we brot all the artillery
safe, and lost very few men at the attack at Clifton. I received
a small wound there myself in the knee, and no other gentleman
touched. We stay'd two days at Carlisle. The third day in
the morning by break o' day we marched, expecting surely to
meet Cumberland that day to give him battle; but perceiving
no enemy, march'd forward, and that night crossed the Esk.
H.R.H. continued on his march without any remarkable
occurencies till he arrived safe with his army at Glasgow.</p>

Memoirs of the Young Pretender's Expedition in 1745, by Highland

<p>On the sixth of January we marched from Glasgow to
Cumbernauld and from thence to Falkirk. Next day orders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
were sent to the army at Perth to join us and with the artillery
to invest Stirling Castle. After staying about a week, four of
our six Highland regiments which were in England were
ordered to march to Linlithgow under night, both to levy the
publick money and carry off the provisions which had been
ordered to be provided for the English army now convened
about Edinburgh under the command of General Hawley who
was advancing towards us.... The Duke of Perth commanded
the siege of Stirling Castle, the Prince's headquarters
being at Bannockburn near Falkirk....</p>

<p>General Hawley (who had been joined by the Argyleshire
Highlanders to the number of about twelve hundred under
General Campbell) with the Government's troops encamped a
little northwest from the toun of Falkirk. The P. finding
General Hawley did not move from his camp at Falkirk to
attack him, held a council of war, January the seventeenth,
about midday, wherein it was resolved to march and attack
Hawley. Accordingly we set out in two columns, and under
the cover of the Tor wood passed the water of Carron at
Dunipace; moving on very quickly to gain the hill above and
lying on the south west of Falkirk our two columns kept at an
equal distance of about two hundred paces till we came in
sight of the enemy about a mile and a half distant from us.
At the same time that we began our march Lord John
Drummond with most of the horse had gone to reconnoitre
the enemy, and made a movement as if he intended to march
by the high way through the Tor wood close up to them, and
this might occasion what some accounts tell us of General
Hawley's perceiving a body of the Highlanders in the Tor
wood, took this appearance to be our whole army, and finding
they did not advance, allowed his troops to dine in their camp.</p>

<p>But to return to our main body; whilst we were making up
towards the hill above Falkirk (as was said) the enemy at last
perceived us and immediately their three regiments of dragoons
were ordered up to gain the ground upon us and hinder our
forming till their foot should form and their cannon be brought
up the hill to support them. The P. seeing the intention of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the enemy, ordered 1500 or 2000 of his Highlanders, led on by
Lord George Murray and Lochiel, to advance and drive the
dragoons from the eminence they had possessed, till the main
body of our men should come up, and to form the right of our
army. This attack upon the dragoons was very quick and
regular; as we came within pistolshot the dragoons made up
to us at a full trot, thinking to bear us down by their weight,
and break us at once, and indeed being well mounted and
accoutred they made a glorious show, sufficient to have struck
other hearts than ours with a pannick. We received them,
however, with a very smart fire, upon which they reeled and
broke into several divisions, some falling back upon their own
foot on the left, others flying out of the field, whilst one body
of them fled off to the right betwixt the front lines of both
armies, which by this time were formed.... As the enemy's
dragoons rode off to their right betwixt the lines, our men ran
eagerly in pursuit of them, but were much surprised to find
themselves stopped by our generals and officers, who with
difficulty restrained them with their drawn swords and cocked
pistols, conjuring them to return to their ground or they would
be undone. As the dragoons in their flight betwixt the lines
passed by our left wing they could not forbear giving them part
of their fire likewise. Our left had not been fully formed when
the attack begun on the right; a considerable body of the
enemy's horse came up also to attack them, but receiving part
of the fire of our left they broke and run off; their infantry
coming in upon that side were opposed by some of our
battalions, who receiving the enemy's fire went in amongst
them sword in hand and drove them down the hill with great
impetuosity and slaughter, but not being in sight of our right
(by reason of the unevenness of the ground) they made a halt
till such time as the two wings should join in the centre and
the second line come up. His R. H., whose attention was
turned to all quarters observing that our left wing was outlined
by the enemy, sent Brigadier Stapleton with the pickets of the
Irish Brigade and some other battalions from the second line,
which extended our first line and recovered the disorder we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
were like to be put into. Then our whole army marched down
towards the enemy, who were retreating on all sides in great
disorder, but by reason of the unevenness of the ground and
night coming on with a storm of wind and rain they could not
overtake them, as they were positively ordered to keep their
ranks. The enemy, finding they could neither possess nor save
their camp, set fire to their tents and retreated with great
precipitation towards Linlithgow, and were just got to the east
end of the toun of Falkirk when Lord John Drummond entered
it on that side, Lord George Murray in the middle, and Lochiel
in the west end of the toun. We took most of their cannon,
ammunition, and baggage which they had not themselves
destroyed. We reckoned about seven hundred of the enemy
taken prisoners and about six hundred men and between thirty
or forty officers killed. We had not above forty men killed on
our side, amongst whom were two or three captains and some
subaltern officers.</p>

<p>The retreat from Stirling was made with the utmost hurry
and confusion. The evening before, Mr. O'Sullivan wrote
from Bannockburn to Lord John Drummond ordering him to
leave Stirling and cross the Forth by break of day, which order
his lordship obeyed, and by 5 in the morning marched. This
surprized the Highlanders, to whose officers it appears these
orders were not communicate, and made them believe the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
enemy was near them, which occasioned such an universal
consternation that they went from Stirling as everyone was
ready, and left most of their baggage, all the cloaths they
brought from Glasgow, and some of their arms.</p>

<p>Lochiel, who had been wounded at Falkirk, not being able
to ride or walk, went in a chaise with Mrs. Murray, and was
driving through St. Ninian's when the church blew up. Some
of the stones came very near them. The horses startled and
threw Mrs. Murray on the street, where she lay speechless
till she was taken up by some of the men. Had there
been any intention to blow up the church, doubtless Lochiel,
one of their principal officers, and the Secretary's lady
had been apprized of it and put on their guard to avoid
danger.</p>

<p>When the Prince join'd the body of the army a Council of
War was held, in which it was debated whether the army
should march in a body to Inverness by Aberdeen or take the
Highland road, by which the chiefs could, with the greater
ease, get such of their men to rejoin them as had gone home
with plunder after the battle of Falkirk, which would considerably
increase their army. The low-country men were of the
former opinion, the Highlanders of the latter. It was put to
the vote, and the latter carried it by a great majority. However,
the Prince was positive for the Aberdeen road, with which
Lochiel complied. But Cluny, going out, met Mr. Murray,
and told him it was surprizing the Prince should be so positive
in a thing contrary to reason and his own instinct, especially
when a great majority of the Council of War were of another
opinion. His expressing himself with a little warmth made
Mr. Murray speak to Sir Thomas Sheridan, who went to the
Prince and prevailed upon him to agree with what had been
the opinion of the Council of War. He marched with the
Highlanders the Highland road by Ruthven in Badenoch, to
Inverness, where it was resolved to attack Fort Augustus and
Fort William. Of either I can give no distinct account,
but that the first was taken, and the siege of the other
deserted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Earl Cromertie and others were sent to different countries to
cover the rising of some and prevent that of others. This
weakened the army, and tho' many joined the day before the
battle of Culloden, a great number did not. Earl of Cromertie,
tho' many expresses were sent to order his returning to
Inverness, in place of doing as commanded, was surprized and
taken prisoner; and these that did join were much fatigued.
None had got pay after they left Tay bridge in their march
north, and they were straightened in provisions for some days
before the battle. Cumberland's army was not opposed in
passing the Spey, tho' a considerable force had been sent there
for that end.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The Prince was in danger of being taken at
MacIntosh's house, and his safety was chiefly owing to a
mistake of Earl of Loudon's men.</p>

<p>Such was the position of my undertaking<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> when, all of a
sudden, news was brought to Inverness that the Duke of
Cumberland, with his army, had passed the Spey on the 13th
of April. The town was in a general alarm, and even in
confusion. Nothing was heard but the noise of bagpipes, the
beating of drums, and the clash of arms. The field of Culloden
was the following day to be the general rendezvous, and every
individual betook himself to his corps.</p>

<p>The army was now mustering upon the field, it being the
14th; but unfortunately we had not been joined by a considerable
number of our men, who were actually upon their march
from different parts of the country, and would have been up in
the course of a few days. The whole of the Macphersons, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
considerable body of the Frasers, some few of the Macintoshes,
in general all the Mackenzies, and several other bodies of men
who had been raised in the more northern counties, had all
received repeated expresses, and were hastening to join the
army. In this situation, divested as it were of part of our
numbers, we hourly expected the Duke. He had come on to
Nairn on the 14th, and was there halting. There was even no
appearance of his moving, the 15th being his birthday. In the
afternoon of that day, the Prince had summoned a council of
war to be held upon the field, and had proposed a plan of a
march under cloud of night, to attack the Duke's army by
surprise, and to force his camp. This plan was worthy even
of any of the greatest heroes of antiquity, and met with general
approbation, particularly amongst the clans. The council
remained long in deliberating in what manner it was to be
conducted. Two essential things, secrecy and expedition, were
the great objects to be observed. There was only one road to
Nairn, which was the high road; and this being covered in
many places with villages, it was essential to avoid it, to
prevent any information being carried to the Duke's army.
The next alternative, and indeed the only one, was to attempt
a way along the foot of a ridge of mountains which fronted the
sea, but had scarcely ever been trod by human foot, and was
known by the name of the Moor-road. It would have brought
us in upon that part of the enemy's camp from which they
could apprehend no danger. It lengthened indeed the road,
which, in the sequel, and from the shortness of the night,
proved our misfortune.</p>

<p>Before the council broke up, every regiment as it were had
his place assigned him in the order of the march. The van
was commanded by Lord George Murray, who, with about
one-third of the army, was to have passed the water of Nairn
about two miles distant from the town, and who, unexpected
by the enemy, was to have invested the Duke's quarters, and
to have made him prisoner. The remaining two-thirds, commanded
by the Duke of Perth and Lord John Drummond,
were to have attacked them from the plain, which, in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
probability, would have been carried sword in hand. It is to
be remarked that the same army had been already surprised at
Falkirk.</p>

<p>Night coming on&mdash;and not sooner could the army begin its
march, to prevent the country people from being alarmed, or
any intelligence being carried to the enemy,&mdash;part of our
numbers, weak as we were, was under a necessity of being
left on the field, in order to save appearances, and light up
fires, as had been done the preceding evening, and to prevent
stragglers, if any there were, forming unnecessary conjectures.
The night was favourable to our wishes, but alas! such a road
was never travelled; the men in general were frequently up to
the ankles, and the horses in many places extricated themselves
with difficulty. In this manner were we retarded almost the
whole of the night; notwithstanding of which, an uncommon
spirit supported itself throughout the army.</p>

<p>It was now the 16th of April, when day began to break about
four in the morning. It was indeed a dreadful knell to us,
being as yet above four long miles from Nairn; nor did we
know what sort of road we had yet to encounter. Appearances
became serious, each was whispering to his neighbour, and, so
far as countenances could be descried, disappointment was
evidently marked. During this critical moment of suspense,
what was to be done? A halt took place; a council was called
as soon as the general officers could be got together. The
morning was fine, and the day was ushering in apace; it
required but little time to deliberate, and finding it impossible
to attack the Duke by surprise, it was judged expedient, for
the safety of the army, to give up the enterprise, and return to
the field of Culloden. Thus were our hopes disappointed. We
saw, as it were before us, the glorious prize; but we durst not
encounter it, for there is almost a moral certainty that we should
have been cut off to a man. The enemy was early in motion,
must have seen us at a considerable distance, and received us
upon the points of their bayonets.</p>

<p>Let us for an instant review the situation of this army.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
They had, for many weeks before the battle, been reduced to a
short allowance of bread; when I say bread, I mean oatmeal,
for they had no other. Must not this have enfeebled their
bodies? Their treasury-chest had been nearly exhausted:
they had received but little money: of course considerable
arrears were owing them. They had passed the 14th and
following night under arms upon the field of battle, every
instant expecting the Duke. Upon the night of the 15th, which
was the eve of the battle, they had performed the march I have
described. Judge, then, what was to be expected from such an
army, worn out with fatigue, and at this moment short of the
common necessaries of life, and outnumbered upwards of two
to one by their enemies; for the Duke's army consisted of at
least eleven thousand men; that of the Prince did not exceed
six, of which we shall find at least a thousand during the action
were asleep in Culloden parks. What, then, can justify the
deliberate folly and madness of fighting under such circumstances?
But our time was come. We were at variance
within ourselves: Irish intriguers and French politics were
too predominant in our councils. These gentlemen, forsooth,
considered themselves as to be but prisoners of war, whilst
every other individual were fighting with halters round their
necks. General appearances upon the field of battle were
much against us. No line was as yet formed; the men
were standing in clusters; and stragglers in small numbers
were coming up from all quarters. Overpowered with fatigue,
they had stopped everywhere on the road, and were now
joining the army.</p>

<p>It being determined to give battle to the Duke, no time was
now lost in forming the lines, and in making every proper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
disposition. The right of the army, commanded by Lord
George Murray, was composed of his own regiment of Athol,
the Camerons, Stuarts of Appin, one battalion of the Frasers,
and the Macintoshes. The left wing, commanded by the
Duke of Perth, consisted of the MacDonalds of Glengarry,
Keppoch, and Clanronald, two companies of MacLeans, two
of MacLeods, and the Farquharsons. The second line, commanded
by Lord John Drummond and Major-general Stapleton,
consisted of the Irish pickets, the regiments of Lord Ogilvy,
Lord Lewis Gordon, Duke of Perth, and Lord John Drummond.
On the right wing, behind the second line, was a troop
of Fitz-James' horse, and on the left part of the horse-guards,
Perthshire squadron, and hussars. The regiment of Kilmarnock's
foot-guards, and Colonel John Roy Stuart, with
such of the men as had no guns, formed a sort of reserve.
The Prince, attended by his aides-de-camp, and Lord
Elcho's guards, placed himself towards the centre, behind
the first line. We had six pieces of cannon; two placed
on the right, two on the left, and two in the centre of the
front line.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland drew up his army in three lines.
The first, commanded by Lieutenant-general the Earl of
Albemarle, consisted of the regiments of Burrel, Monro,
Scot's Fusiliers, Price, Cholmondley and St. Clair. The
second, commanded by Major-general Huske, consisted of the
regiments of Wolfe, Ligonier, Sempill, Bligh, and Fleming.
The third line, commanded by Brigadier Mordaunt, consisted
of the regiments of Blackney, Battereau, Pultney, and
Howard. On the right wing were placed Cobham's dragoons,
and the half of Kingston's horse; and on the left Ker's
dragoons, and the other half of Kingston's horse, with the
Campbells of Argyle. Ten pieces of cannon were placed in
the first line, two between each regiment, and six pieces in the
second line.</p>

<p>The enemy formed at a considerable distance, and marched
on in order of battle, outlining us both on the right and on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
left. About one o'clock the cannonading began; and the
Duke's artillery, being well served, could not fail of doing
execution. One of the Prince's grooms, who led a sumpter
horse, was killed upon the spot; some of the guards were
wounded, as were several of the horse. One Austin, a very
worthy, pleasant fellow, stood on my left; he rode a fine mare,
which he was accustomed to call his lady. He perceived her
give a sudden shrink, and, on looking around him, called out,
"Alas! I have lost my lady!" One of her hind legs was shot,
and hanging by the skin. He that instant dismounted, and,
endeavouring to push her out of the ranks, she came to the
ground. He took his gun and pistols out of the holsters,
stepped forward, joined the foot, but was never more heard of.
The Prince, observing this disagreeable position, and without
answering any end whatever, ordered us down to a covered
way, which was a little towards our right, and where we were
less annoyed with the Duke's cannon; he himself, with his
aides-de-camp, rode along the line towards the right, animating
the soldiers. The guards had scarce been a minute or two in
this position, when the small arms began from the Duke's
army, and kept up a constant fire; that instant, as it were, one
of the aides-de-camp returned, and desired us to join the
Prince. We met him in endeavouring to rally the soldiers,
who, annoyed with the enemy's fire, were beginning to quit the
field. The right of our army, commanded by Lord George
Murray, had made a furious attack, cut their way through
Burrel's and Monro's regiments, and had taken possession of
two pieces of cannon; but a reinforcement of Wolfe's<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
regiment, etc., coming up from the Duke's second line, our
right wing was obliged to give way, being at the same time
flanked with some pieces of artillery, which did great execution.
Towards the left the attack had been less vigorous than on the
right, and of course had made but little impression on the
Duke's army; nor was it indeed general, for the centre, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
had been much galled by the enemy's artillery, almost instantly
quitted the field.</p>

<p>The scene of confusion was now great; nor can the imagination
figure it. The men in general were betaking themselves
precipitately to flight; nor was there any possibility of their
being rallied. Horror and dismay was painted in every
countenance. It now became time to provide for the Prince's
safety: his person had been abundantly exposed. He was got
off the field, and very narrowly escaped falling in with a body
of horse, which had been detached from the Duke's left, were
advancing with an incredible rapidity, picking up the stragglers,
and, as they gave no quarter, were levelling them with the
ground. The greater numbers of the army were already out
of danger, the flight having been so precipitate. We got upon
a rising ground, where we turned round and made a general
halt. The scene was, indeed, tremendous. Never was so
total a rout&mdash;a more thorough discomfiture of an army. The
adjacent country was in a manner covered with its ruins. The
whole was over in about twenty-five minutes. The Duke's
artillery kept still playing, though not a soul upon the field.
His army was kept together, all but the horse. The great
pursuit was upon the road towards Inverness. Of towards six
thousand men, which the Prince's army at this period consisted
of, about one thousand were asleep in Culloden parks, who
knew nothing of the action till awaked by the noise of the
cannon. These in general endeavoured to save themselves by
taking the road towards Inverness; and most of them fell a
sacrifice to the victors, for this road was in general strewed
with dead bodies. The Prince at this moment had his cheeks
bedewed with tears; what must not his feeling heart have
suffered?</p>

<p class="hd5"><i>Copy of <span class="smcap">Captain O'Neille's</span> Journal, taken from an attested
copy by his name subscribed with his own hand.</i></p>

<p>That night<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the Prince retir'd six miles from the field of
battle and went next day as far, and in three days more arrived
at Fort Augustus, where he remained a whole day in expectation
his troops would have join'd him. But seeing no appearance
of it, he went to the house of Invergary and ordered me to
remain there to direct such as pass'd that way the road he took.
I remained there two days and announc'd the Prince's orders
to such as I met, but to no effect, every one taking his own
road.</p>

<p>I then followed the Prince, who was so far from making a
precipitate retreat [as has been maliciously reported] that he
retired by six and six miles and arrived the 28th of April O.S.
at Knoidart, where I join'd him next day and gave him an
account of the little or no appearance there was of assembling
his troops, upon which he wrote circular letters to all the
chieftains, enjoining them, by the obedience they owed him, to
join him immediately with such of their clans as they could
gather; at the same time representing to them the imminent
danger they were in if they neglected it. After remaining some
days there in hopes his orders would have been obeyed, and
seeing not one person repair to him, the extreme danger his
person was in, being within seven miles of Lord Loudon, Sir
Alexander MacDonald and the MacLeods, it was proposed to
evade it by retreating to one of the islands near the continent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
After repeated instances of the like nature he reluctantly
assented, leaving Mr. John Hay behind to transmit him the
answers of his letters, with an account of what should pass, and
parted for the Isles in an open fishing boat at eight at night,
attended by Colonel O'Sullivan and me only. About an hour
after we parted a violent hurricane arose, which drove us ninety
miles<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> from our designed port; and next day running for shelter
into the Island of North Uist,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> we struck upon a rock and
staved to pieces, and with great difficulty saved our lives. At
our landing we were in the most melancholy situation, knowing
nobody and wanting the common necessaries of life. After
much search we found a little hut uninhabited, and took shelter
there, and with a great deal of pains made a fire to dry our
cloaths. Here the Prince remained two days, having no other
provisions but a few biskets we had saved out of the boat,
which were entirely spoiled with the salt water.</p>

<p>As this island belonged to Sir Alexander MacDonald, and
not judging ourselves safe, we determined going elsewhere, and
by the greatest good fortune, one of our boatmen discovered a
boat stranded on the coast, and having with great difficulty
launched it into the water, we embarked for the Harris. In
our passage we unfortunately met with another storm which
obliged us to put into an island near Stornoway.... And
meeting with three ships of war we were constrained to put
into a desert island where we remained eight days in the
greatest misery, having no sustenance but some dried fish that
Providence threw in our way in this island. When the ships
disappeared we put to sea again, and next morning met with
another ship of war just coming out of one of the lochs, who
pursued us for near an hour; but the wind rising we made our
escape. In the afternoon we arrived at the Island of Benbecula....
Here we remained some days longer, till the Duke of
Cumberland having intelligence that the Prince was concealed
in the Long Isle, ordered the militia of the Isle of Sky and the
Independent Companies to go in search of him. As soon as
we had notice of their landing we retreated to an island about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
twelve miles distance, called Ouya, where we remained till we
found they had followed us, and then we went for Loch
Boisdale, and stayed there eight days, when Captain Carolina
Scott landed within a mile of us, which obliged us to separate,
the Prince taking me to the mountains, and O'Sullivan remaining
with the boatmen.</p>

<p class="hd5"><i>Journal taken from the mouth of <span class="smcap">Miss Flora MacDonald</span> by
<span class="smcap">Dr. Burton</span> of York, when in Edinburgh.</i></p>

<p>Miss MacDonald had gone from Sky to Milton in South
Uist in order to visit her brother-german, who had about that
time taken up house. She had not been long there till Captain
O'Neil (by some lucky accident or other) had become acquainted
with her. When the Prince was surrounded with difficulties
on all hands, and knew not well what to do for his future safety,
Captain O'Neil brought Miss MacDonald to the place where
the Prince was, and there they concerted the plan. At that
time Miss returned to Milton. After Miss MacDonald had
(with some difficulty) agreed to undertake the dangerous
enterprize, she set out for Clanranald's house, Saturday,
June 21st, and at one of the fords was taken prisoner by a
party of militia, she not having a passport. She demanded to
whom they belonged? And finding by the answer that her
step-father was then commander, she refused to give any
answers till she should see their captain. So she and her
servant, Neil MacKechan, were prisoners all that night.</p>

<p>Her stepfather, coming next day, being Sunday, she told him
what she was about, upon which he granted a passport for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
herself, a manservant (Neil MacKechan), and another woman,
Bettie Burk, a good spinster, and whom he recommended as
such in a letter to his wife at Armadale in Sky, as she had
much lint to spin. If her stepfather (Hugh MacDonald of
Armadale) had not granted Miss a passport, she could not have
undertaken her journey and voyage. Armadale set his stepdaughter
at liberty, who immediately made the best of her way
to Clanranald's house and acquainted the Lady Clanranald with
the scheme, who supplied the Prince with apparel sufficient for
his disguise, viz. a flower'd linen gown, a white apron, etc., and
sent some provisions along with him.</p>

<p>During Miss MacDonald's stay at Clanranald's house,
which was till the Friday, June 27th, O'Neil went several
times betwixt the Prince and Miss, in which interval another
scheme was proposed, that the Prince should go under the
care of a gentleman to the north ward, but that failing them,
they behoved to have recourse to that agreed upon before; and
accordingly Lady Clanranald, one Mrs. MacDonald, O'Neil,
Miss Flora MacDonald, and her servant, Neil MacKechan,
went to the place where the Prince was, being about eight
Scotch miles. He was then in a very little house or hut,
assisting in the roasting of his dinner, which consisted of the
heart, liver, kidneys, etc., of a bullock or sheep, upon a wooden
spit. O'Neil introduced his young preserver and the company,
and she sat on the Prince's right hand and Lady Clanranald on
his left. Here all dined very heartily....</p>

<p>When all were gone who were not to accompany the Prince
in his voyage to the Isle of Sky, Miss MacDonald desired him
to dress himself in his new attire, which was soon done, and at
a proper time they removed their quarters and went near the
water with their boat afloat, nigh at hand for readiness to
embark in case of an alarm from the shore. Here they arrived,
very wet and wearied, and made a fire upon a rock to keep
them somewhat warm till night. They were soon greatly
alarmed by seeing four wherries full of armed men making
towards shore, which made them extinguish their fire quickly,
and to conceal themselves among the heath....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>At eight o'clock, June 28th, Saturday, 1746, the Prince,
Miss Flora MacDonald, Neil MacKechan, etc., set sail in a
very clear evening from Benbecula to the Isle of Sky. It is
worth observing here that Benbecula is commonly reckoned a
part of South Uist, they being divided from one another by the
sea only at high water, which then makes a short ferry betwixt
the two; but at low water people walk over upon the sand
from the one to the other.</p>

<p>They had not rowed from the shore above a league till the
sea became rough, and at last tempestuous, and to entertain the
company the Prince sung several songs and seemed to be in
good spirits.</p>

<p>In the passage Miss MacDonald fell asleep, and then the
Prince carefully guarded her, lest in the darkness any of the
men should chance to step upon her. She awaked in a
surprise with some little bustle in the boat, and wondered what
was the matter, etc....</p>

<p>From hence they rowed on and landed at Kilbride, in
Troternish, in the Isle of Sky, about twelve miles north from
the above-mentioned point. There were also several parties of
militia in the neighbourhood of Kilbride. Miss left the Prince
in the boat and went with her servant, Neil MacKechan, to
Mougstot, Sir Alexander MacDonald's house, and desired one
of the servants to let Lady Margaret MacDonald know she
was come to see her ladyship in her way to her mother's house.
Lady Margaret knew her errand well enough by one Mrs. MacDonald,
who had gone a little before to apprize her of it.</p>

<p>As Mr. Alexander MacDonald of Kingsburgh was accidentally
there, Lady Margaret desired him to conduct the
Prince to his house; for it is to be remarked that Lady
Margaret did not see the Prince in any shape. Kingsburgh
sent a boy down to the boat with instructions whither to
conduct the Prince about a mile, and he (Kingsburgh) would
be there ready to conduct him. Then Kingsburgh took some
wine, etc., to refresh the Prince with, and set forwards for the
place of rendezvous, leaving Miss MacDonald with Lady
Margaret at Mougstot, where the commanding officer of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
parties in search of the Prince was, and who asked Miss
whence she came, whither she was going, what news? etc., all
which Miss answered as she thought most proper, and so as to
prevent any discovery of what she had been engaged in.</p>

<p>Lady MacDonald pressed Miss very much in presence of
the officer to stay, telling her that she had promised to make
some stay the first time she should happen to come there.
But Miss desired to be excused at that time, because she
wanted to see her mother, and to be at home in these troublesome
times. Lady Margaret at last let her go, and she and
Mrs. MacDonald above mentioned set forwards with Neil
MacKechan and said Mrs. MacDonald's maid and her
man-servant. They overtook the Prince and Kingsburgh.
Mrs. MacDonald was very desirous to see the Prince's
countenance; but as he went along he always turned away his
face from Mrs. MacDonald to the opposite side whenever he
perceived her endeavouring to stare him in the countenance.
But yet she got several opportunities of seeing his face,
though in disguise, which the maid could not help taking
notice of, and said she had never seen such an impudent-looked
woman, and durst say she was either an Irish woman or else a
man in a woman's dress. Miss MacDonald replied she was
an Irish woman, for she had seen her before. The maid also
took notice of the Prince's awkward way of managing the
petticoats, and what long strides he took in walking along, etc.,
which obliged Miss MacDonald to desire Mrs. MacDonald
(they being both on horseback), to step a little faster and leave
those on foot, because, as there were many parties of militia in
the great roads, it was necessary for the Prince to cross the
country, and it was not proper to let Mrs. MacDonald's man
or maid servant see it. So on they went, and the Prince and
Kingsburgh went over the hills and travelled south-south-east
till they arrived at Kingsburgh's house, which was about
twelve o'clock at night, and they were very wet....</p>

<p>The day was far advanced before he<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> set out, and when he
arrived at a wood side (as the affair had been concerted), not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
far from Kingsburgh, he changed his apparel once more and
put on the Highland dress Kingsburgh had furnished him with.
Then Kingsburgh sent a guide with him to Portree, thro' all
byways, while Miss MacDonald went thither on horseback by
another road, thereby the better to gain intelligence and at the
same time to prevent a discovery. They were very wet, it
having rained very much. Here he only dried his clothes,
took some little refreshment, and staid about two hours.</p>

<p>Hither Kingsburgh had sent to prepare a boat, and to have
it ready to convey the Prince to the place where he wanted to
be at, not allowing the people about Portree in the meantime
to know anything about the person's being the Prince whom
they were to receive and to take care of. Young MacLeod
of Raaza came with Malcolm MacLeod to conduct the Prince
over to the Island of Raaza. The Prince was very uneasy he
had not a MacDonald to conduct him still. He left Portree
on Tuesday, the 1st of July, and landed that very same day at
a place called Glam in Raaza.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald took leave of the Prince at Portree, and
from thence went to her mother, after a fatiguing journey cross
the country. She never told her mother, or indeed anybody
else, what she had done.</p>

of their meeting with Charles; and the extraordinary habitation called
the Cage, where Charles lived with them, till he received notice that
two French frigates were arrived at Lochnanuagh.</i></p>

<p>After the fatal catastrophe of the Highland army at Culloden,
upon the 16th of April, 1746, they meant to make head again
about Cluchnicarry, till, upon Lord Loudon's approach with
an army, the few that had got together were made to disperse.
Locheil being then bad of his wounds, was obliged to shift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
from his own country to the Braes of Rannoch, near which,
about the 20th of June, in a hill called Benouchk, Cluny
Macpherson met him, and Sir Stuart Threipland, physician,
who attended him for the cure of his wounds. Cluny brought
them from thence to Benalder, a hill of great circumference in
that part of Badenoch next to Rannoch, and his own ordinary
grassings;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> where they remained together, without ever getting
any certain notice of what had become of the Prince for near
three months, when they received the agreeable news of his
being safe at Locharkaik....</p>

<p>The Prince lay the first night at Corineuir, after his coming
to Badenoch, from which he was conducted next day to Mellanauir,
a shealing of very narrow compass, where Locheil,
with Macpherson of Breakachie, Allan Cameron, his principal
servant, and two servants of Cluny were at the time. It cannot
but be remarked, that, when Locheil saw five men approaching
under arms, being the Prince, Lochgary, Dr. Cameron, and
two servants, taking the five men to be of the army or militia,
which lay encamped not above four or five miles from them,
and were probably in search of them; as it was in vain to
think of flying, Locheil at the time being quite lame, and not
in any condition to travel, much less to run away; it was
resolved that the enemy, as they judged them to be, should
be received with a general discharge of all the arms; in number
twelve firelocks and some pistols.... But the auspicious
hand of Almighty God ... prevented those within from firing
at the Prince with his four attendants; for they came at last
so near that they were known by those within.... Locheil
then ushered him into his habitation, which was indeed but
a very poor one. The Prince was gay, and in better spirits
than it was possible to think he could have been, considering
the many disasters, disappointments, fatigues and difficulties,
he had undergone. His Royal Highness, with his retinue,
went into the hut; and there was more meat and drink provided
for him than he expected. There was plenty of mutton,
an anker of whisky, containing twenty Scots pints, some good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
beef sausages made the year before, with plenty of butter and
cheese, besides a large well cured bacon ham. Upon his entry,
the Prince took a hearty dram, which he sometimes called for
thereafter, to drink the healths of his friends. When some
minced collops were dressed with butter, in a large sauce-pan,
which Locheil and Cluny always carried about with them, being
the only fire vessel they had, His Royal Highness eat heartily,
and said with a very cheerful countenance: "Now, gentlemen,
I live like a Prince:" though at the same time he was no otherwise
entertained than eating his collops out of the pan, with
a silver spoon....</p>

<p>The day after Clunie arrived, he thought it time to remove
from Mellanauir, and took the Prince about two miles further
into Benalder, to a little sheil called Uiskchibra, where the
hut or bothie was superlatively bad and smoky; yet His
Royal Highness put up with everything. Here he remained
for two or three nights; and then removed to a very romantic
habitation, made for him by Clunie, two miles further into
Benalder, called the Cage; which was a great curiosity, and
can scarcely be described to perfection. It was situated in
the face of a very rough, high and rocky mountain, called
Letternilichk, still a part of Benalder, full of great stones and
crevices, and some scattered wood interspersed. The habitation
called the Cage, in the face of that mountain, was within
a small thick bush of wood. There were first some rows of
trees laid down, in order to level a floor for the habitation;
and as the place was steep, this raised the lower side to an
equal height with the other; and these trees, in the way of
joists or planks, were levelled with earth and gravel. There
were betwixt the trees, growing naturally on their own roots,
some stakes fixed in the earth, which, with the trees, were
interwoven with ropes, made of heath and birch twigs, up to
the top of the Cage, it being of a round or rather oval shape;
and the whole thatched and covered over with fog.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> This
whole fabric hung, as it were, by a large tree, which reclined
from the one end, all along the roof to the other, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
gave it the name of the Cage, and by chance there happened
to be two stones at a small distance from one another, in the
side next the precipice, resembling the pillars of a chimney
where the fire was placed. The smoke had its vent out here,
all along the face of the rock, which was so much of the same
colour, that one could discover no difference in the clearest
day. The Cage was no larger than to contain six or seven
persons; four of whom were frequently employed playing at
cards, one idle looking on, one baking, and another firing bread
and cooking. Here His Royal Highness remained till the
13th of September, when he was informed that the vessels
for receiving and carrying him to France were arrived at
Lochnanuagh. The Prince set out immediately; and travelling
only by night, arrived at Borodale, near Lochnanuagh, on the
19th of September, and embarked there on the 20th.</p>

<p>This book attempts to make a really interesting, simple and suggestive
introduction to industrial and economic history. It is intended to induce
our young men and women of all classes to study earnestly this important
subject, which has, up to the present, been impossible, because the text-books
are too expensive or else too learned and academic.</p>

<p class="center"><big>By S. M. TOYNE, M.A., Late Senior History Master at
Haileybury College. 1<i>s.</i></big></p>

<p>It is suggested that this volume may be of considerable assistance not only
to students using the ordinary text-books, but also to those whose work is
based on some such series as Messrs. Bell's <b>English History Source
Books</b>. The author's object has been to produce a volume that will be
an aid to, and not a substitute for, reading, and it is hoped that it may be
of value as giving a summary of important events and a review of national
development.</p>

<p class="center"><small>ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, FORMERLY

<p>Among the topics dealt with in this brilliant and most original study are:
Greek morality, a general view; the morality of the Cosmopolitan Age, of
the Roman Republic, and Empire; some aspects of the Middle Ages;
theory and practice, 1265-1600; the psychological problems of modern
life and the political and religious aspects of conduct.</p>

<p><small>"The book will be found helpful to any one who takes an intelligent interest in the
subjects which it treats. The author has read widely and grasped what he has read; he
does not aim at originality, but he succeeds in being essentially fairminded, and his
summary, which gives the kernel of many authorities, will be of real use as an introduction
both to politics and ethics separately, but more particularly in their relations to each
other."&mdash;<i>Cambridge Review.</i></small></p>
